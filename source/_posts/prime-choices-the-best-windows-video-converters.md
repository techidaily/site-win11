 Freemake Video Converter is a popular video converter with over 103 million downloads, available for Windows. With its well-designed user interface, you can use it to convert one or multiple files, but there is a caveat.

 A common feature across video converters are presets, and Freemake Video Converter is no different. Presets are built-in output profiles that let you convert videos for different devices and file formats. You can use the built-in output profiles to convert videos to different formats or devices, including Android, Apple, gaming consoles, and web players. If the presets don't work, you can create custom output settings.

 The app is easy to use, with all the features to convert your videos on the timeline. You can add audio and subtitles to the video if missing, but the features list ends just there.

 While the processing and conversion happen quickly, a big caveat is the Freemake watermark. On the free version, you'll find the converters pasting their watermark in the beginning and all over the video, which is unpleasant, to say the least. You can, however, subscribe to its monthly subscription starting at $39.95 per month or a lifetime version at $59.95 to remove the watermark. A purchase will also unlock more premium features, including full HD support, better conversion speed, more presets, and a subtitles editor.

 If you consider a purchase, look out for discount pop-ups when using the app to get better lifetime deals.
