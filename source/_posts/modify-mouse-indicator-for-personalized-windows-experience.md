## Modify Mouse Indicator for Personalized Windows Experience

 Although the Windows computer comes preset with a default mouse cursor, not everyone is a fan. Thankfully, Microsoft comes with a feature on Windows that lets you set a new cursor or modify your existing cursor for a newer, refined one.

 Today, we'll tackle exactly that. We'll dive into the different ways to tweak the mouse cursor on your Windows computer and then lay out how you can do it, too.

## How to Change Your Cursor on Windows

 There's a lot you can do to change your cursor. For example, you can entirely change the cursor type, tweak the cursor scheme, or even modify the cursor color or speed. So, with a few tweaks here and there, you can change almost everything about your mouse cursor. If you want something totally unique, you can even[import a custom mouse cursor on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-custom-mouse-cursor/) .

 We'll go through all of them individually, starting with changing the individual cursor.

## Change the Mouse Cursor on Windows

 To launch your mouse settings, head to the**Start menu** search bar, type in "mouse," and select the**Change your mouse settings** option. Now, in**Change your mouse settings** , click on**Additional mouse options** .

![touchpad settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/touchpad-settings-1.JPG)

 The**Mouse Properties** dialog box will be launched. From there, click on the**Pointers** tab; then, head to the dropdown under**Scheme** and select the cursor you'd like to set.

 Apart from the Scheme, you also get a fairly different number of ways to customize your mouse. For example, click**Browse** under the**Customize** section, and you'll get a list of cursor options to pick from. Select the cursor you want and click on**Open** .

 Finally, click on**Apply** to confirm your new cursor settings.

## Change the Color of Your Cursor

 Almost all Windows operating systems come preset with a white cursor. However, you can change that with a few tweaks.

1. Head to the**Mouse pointer** settings page, and click on**Adjust mouse & cursor size** .
2. Finally, choose a specific color from under the**Change pointer color** section.

## Tweak the Cursor Size

 While changing the cursor color, you can also try your hand at the Cursor Size. This can be particularly helpful if you struggle with weak eyesight. You can change the size of your cursor right from the Settings menu.

* Open the**Mouse** settings page from the Windows Settings.
* Click on**Adjust mouse & cursor size** .
* Now, drag the pointer under the**Change point size** menu to adjust the cursor size.

## Change the Cursor Speed

 Don't like the default speed of your mouse? No problem. You can tweak its speed with ease through the Setting menu. To get started, follow the steps below:

1. Open the Settings menu by pressing the**Windows Key + I** shortcut.
2. Head to**Devices > Mouse** .
3. Select**Change other mouse options** .
4. Now, use the**Cursor speed** slider and adjust how fast (or slow) the cursor can move.  
![adjust mouse and cursor size option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/adjust-mouse-and-cursor-size-option.jpg)

 As soon as you move the slider, your mouse speed will be adjusted as you like.

 Similarly, you can tweak the slider to**Choose how many lines to scroll each time** for

## Make Use of the Control Panel to Tweak Your Cursor

 The**Control Panel** is one of the oldest apps in the Windows operating system, first released way back in 1985\. It is majorly used for managing your computer hardware and software.

 Naturally, you can change your cursor settings with Windows Control Panel as well; this can be super handy if both Settings or Mouse Properties don't work for you for some reason. Here are the different ways you can[open the Control Panel](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-control-panel/) .

* Head to the**Start menu** search bar, type in "control panel," and select the best match.
* Click on**Ease of Access > Ease of Access Center** .
* Select the**Make mouse easier to use** option.  
![make the mouse easier to use](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/make-the-mouse-easier-to-use.jpg)

 On the next page, you'll get three different sections from where you can tweak your mouse settings:

1. Mouse pointers
2. Control the mouse with the keyboard
3. Make it easier to manage Windows

 From the**Mouse pointers** section, you can change the color and size of mouse pointers that will be more suitable for your personalized settings; Regular White, Large Black, Extra Large Inverting, etc., are just some of the designs to pick from.

 Next, the**Control the mouse with the keyboard** section lets you turn on your mouse keys, which basically means you can move your mouse around with the numeric keypad itself.

 Similarly, when you check the radio box for**Turn on Mouse Keys** , you'll be able to use a numeric keypad to move the mouse around the screen.

## Customize Your Windows Cursor to Your Taste

 When most users are looking to tweak their user interface, changing the cursor is often not the first thing that springs to mind. However, tweaking your mouse settings here and there can always add icing to the cake.
