## Win11 Steps to Correct Steam File Privileges Failure

 Is Steam showing the “Missing file privileges” error when you try to launch or update one of your games? Most of the time, you have to launch Steam as administrator to grant it the right permissions to work properly. However, there are other reasons such as a corrupted download cache or incorrect Steam settings.

 Either way, going through the instructions below should help you fix the issue.

## 1\. Launch Steam as an Administrator

 Steam might run into the missing file error if it doesn’t have the right permissions. Right-click the Steam client and select **Run as administrator**. Then, try to launch the problematic game.

 f Steam no longer displays the same error, you should [set Steam to always run with administrative privileges](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/always-run-apps-administrator-windows/).

## 2\. Stop the IgfxEmN Module Process

 The Intel Graphic Executable Main Module includes the igfxEM process. There’s a chance the process is conflicting with Steam’s functionality and stop it from updating or opening games from its library. In this case, you should stop the process.

 Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to launch Task Manager and open the **Processes** tab. There, right-click **igfxEM Module** and select **End task**. Once you stop the process, restart Steam and check if the issue is now solved.

## 3\. Delete Steam's Cache

 Another possible cause for Steam’s “Missing file privileges” error might be a corrupt download cache. Follow these steps to delete Steam’s cache and fix the issue:

1. Launch the Steam client.
2. Click **Steam** in the top-left corner and head to **Settings**.
3. From the left pane, select **Downloads**.
4. Click **Clear Download Cache**.
5. Confirm the action**.**

 Clearing the Steam cache will not affect any of the installed games. However, you might notice a decrease in the Steam client’s performance as it rebuilds the cache. But it shouldn't take long.

## 4\. Check Steam Download Settings

 To ensure you’ll have no problem connecting to its servers, Steam chooses by default the closest one. But if you’ve been traveling and Steam failed to reconnect to a new server or there’s a malfunction with the current server, you might run into the file privileges error.

 Here’s how you can connect to a different Steam download server:

1. Launch the Steam app.
2. Head to **Steam > Settings** **\> Downloads**.
3. Open the **Download region** menu and select the server that’s closest to you.

## 5\. Check the Game's File Integrity

 If you run into the "Missing file privileges" error when trying to launch a certain game, probably some of the game files are corrupted or even missing. Fortunately, you don’t have to reinstall the game as Steam can fix the problem for you by checking the files' integrity.

1. Launch the Steam app and go to **Library**.
2. Right-click the malfunctioning game and select **Properties**.
3. From the left pane, open **Installed Files**.
4. Select **Verify integrity of game files**.

## 6\. Repair the Library Folders

 If you’re still having the same problem after fixing the game files, you should repair the Steam library folder. The folder contains the data for every downloaded game so if its content somehow got corrupted, you’ll be unable to launch or update your games.

 To repair the folder, head to Steam Settings as we’ve shown before. There, go to **Storage > Steam Library Folders**. Click the **three-dot** icon next to the folder path and select **Repair Folder**. Confirm the action, wait until the process is complete, and restart the Steam app.

## 7\. Reinstall the Game

 If the game’s core files are corrupt or something went wrong during the last update, you might have no choice but to [uninstall and reinstall the Steam game](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-uninstall-steam-games-reinstall/). In case you can’t launch any game from your library, the problem might be with the Steam app. So, you can take this a step further and reinstall Steam on your computer.
