## Hasten Enabling/Disabling: Microsoft's Bing Assistant in Taskbar

 Would you like to receive web-based recommendations when using the Taskbar search box in addition to local results? If so, activate the Bing AI chatbot, which seamlessly directs your search queries from the search box to the Bing Chat page through the Edge browser.

 Today, we'll explain how to swiftly enable or disable Bing Chat AI in the Windows 11 Taskbar search. Let's get started!

## How to Use Bing Chat AI

 Bing Chat was initially released as only a waitlist; it's now available publicly at Bing.com**.** You'll need a Microsoft account and the[latest version of Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download?form=MA13FJ) to access it. Once you have met these requirements, you can access Bing Chat in three ways.

 The first method is to launch Microsoft Edge and navigate to Bing.com using the search bar. Then, click the**Chat** option at the top to open Bing Chat.

 The second method involves clicking the**Bing Chat icon** in the right sidebar (aka Edge copilot) of the Edge browser. The third method is through the Search on Taskbar for Windows 11\. However, this feature is disabled by default and needs to be manually enabled before use.

 Furthermore, some people don't use this feature. If you haven't tried it yet, you should[get started with the Windows 11 taskbar search bar](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-taskbar-search/) .

 You can use Bing Chat to search for anything on your mind. For example, if you search for the "largest continent in the world," Bing Chat will retrieve information from across the internet and provide appropriate answers.

 You will also receive numbered footnotes with website links containing information about your question. You can click these links to obtain a more detailed answer to your query. Alternatively, if you prefer to continue chatting, simply type your follow-up question in the search bar and hit Enter.

## Enable or Disable the Bing Chat AI

3. Choose**Search permissions.**
