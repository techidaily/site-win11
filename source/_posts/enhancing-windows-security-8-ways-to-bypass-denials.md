## Enhancing Windows Security: 8 Ways to Bypass Denials

 While trying to sign in on your Windows device, you suddenly bump into an error message that reads, “the sign-in method you’re trying to use isn’t allowed.” What causes this issue, and how do you resolve it?

 We’ve got all the solutions for you! So, let’s dive in and explore how you can tackle this problem once and for all.

## 1\. Sign Into Windows Using a System Administrator Account

![A lady using a Windows PC while holding a cup](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/A-lady-using-a-Windows-PC-while-holding-a-cup.jpg)

 The issue at hand usually pops up when using a local account. So, the easiest solution is to use a system administrator account when you're on the “sign-in” page.

 But if you’re using someone else’s PC, then maybe the system administrator has blocked some sign-in methods. In this case, you can only sign in on the device once the owner configures some system settings.

## 2\. Enable the “Allow Log On Locally” Option in the Local Group Policy Editor

![A person typing commands on a laptop](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/A-person-typing-commands-on-a-laptop.jpg)

 Experiencing this issue while using your other local account? If so, then the issue might be coming from your administrator account.

 If you’re the system administrator, it’s highly likely that you’ve prevented others from signing in to your device with local accounts. In this case, this will also prevent you from signing in on the device using your other local accounts.

 To resolve this problem, you need to tweak a few settings in the Local Group Policy Editor (LGPE) as follows:

1. Log in to your administrator account. If you’re using someone else’s device, then you’d have to ask them to perform these methods.
2. Press **Win + R** to open the Run command dialog box.
3. Type **gpedit.msc** and click **OK** to open the LGPE.
4. Navigate to **Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment**.
5. Locate and double-click on the **Allow log on locally** policy.

![Clicking the the Allow log on locally option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/clicking-the-the-allow-log-on-locally-option.jpg)

 From there, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Local Security Settings** tab.
2. Click the **Add User or Group** option to add your local account to the list.
3. Click the **Advanced** button to access the account selection page.
4. Click the **Find Now** button on the right-hand side pane to get a complete list of local accounts. The search results will appear at the bottom of the same window.
5. Locate and click the local account that you’re facing issues with. From there, click **OK** and then follow the on-screen steps to finalize the process.

## 3\. Sign In Using a Different Local Account

 In some cases, this issue might be specific to a certain local account. So, signing in with a different local account might help.

 Now, here’s how to sign in to Windows using a different local account:

1. Press **Win + I** to access the system settings.
2. Select **Accounts** from the menu items.
3. Select the **Email & accounts** option on the left.
4. Click the **Add a Microsoft account** option on the right and then follow the on-screen instructions.

 By now, the “sign-in” method issue should be resolved. But if that’s not the case, then maybe the error is caused by some system bugs. Now, an easy way out here is to scan your computer and fix any issues it might have.

 In this case, you can use the Check Disk (CHKDSK) tool to [scan and repair system issues](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-built-in-repair-tools/).

 Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Type **Command Prompt** in the Start menu search bar.
2. Right-click on the **Best match** result and select **Run as administrator**.
3. Type the following command and press **Enter**:

chkdsk C: /f

 In this case, the **C:** command represents the letter of the hard drive. If you’ve installed Windows on a different drive, then replace this command with the letter of the correct hard drive.

 Once the scan is complete, restart your device to save these changes.

 Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Press **Win + I** to open the system settings.
2. Select **Update & Security** from the options.
3. Click **Windows Security** on the left.
4. Select **Virus & threat protection** on the right.
5. Click **Scan options** in the middle pane.
6. Select any relevant scan option from the list and then press the **Scan now** button.
