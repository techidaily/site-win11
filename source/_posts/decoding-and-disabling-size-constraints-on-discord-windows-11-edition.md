## Decoding and Disabling Size Constraints on Discord (Windows 11 Edition)

 A picture says a thousand words, which is why we use images and GIFs to make our conversations on Discord more interesting. However, what if Discord fails to upload a GIF emote and gives you the "cannot resize GIF" error?

 This error typically occurs when the GIF size exceeds Discord's supported limits. Fortunately, it's very easy to troubleshoot this error. Below, we'll look at various solutions to fix the Discord "cannot resize GIF" error on Windows.

## 1\. Optimize the GIF

 On Discord, file uploads are limited to a maximum of 8 MB. However, GIF emotes must not be more than 256 KB and should have dimensions of 128x128 pixels or less. If you try to upload a GIF that surpasses these size restrictions, you will encounter the "cannot resize GIF" error.

 To fix this issue, you'll have to optimize the GIF before uploading it on Discord. You can use any available GIF optimizers, but we recommend using **Ezgif** as it is free to use and quickly optimizes GIFs. Here's how to use it:

1. Visit the [Ezgif website](https://ezgif.com/optimize).
2. Click the **Choose** **File** button and select the GIF that's throwing the error on uploading on Discord.  
![Choose File on Ezgif website](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/choose-file.jpg)
3. Click the **Upload** button.
4. Use the **Compression level slider** to manually adjust the amount of compression. If your GIF is large in size, set the slider at a higher level.

5. Click the **Optimize GIF** button.
6. Click the **Save** button.

 Now, check if you can upload the GIF. If not, probably the resolution is more than 128\*128 pixels. To reduce the resolution, follow the below steps:

1. Switch to the **Resize** tab.
2. Click the Choose Files button and upload the optimized GIF.
3. Type **128** in both the **Width** and **Height** fields. Then, click the **Resize image** button.

4. Click the **Save** icon.

## 2\. Log Out and Back Into the Discord App

 Discord's "cannot resize GIF" error can also occur due to a temporary glitch or bug with your Discord account. In this case, the best solution is to log out and in on your Discord app. Here's how to do that:

1. Launch Discord on your computer and click the **Gear icon** at the bottom left corner.
2. Click the **Log Out** option on the left sidebar.

3. Enter your credentials and click the **Log In** button.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 After that, try to upload the GIF and check if you still face the error.

## 3\. Clear the Discord Cache Data

 Discord's cache stores all your media, so you don't have to re-download them every time you see it. However, whether it's because of malware attacks, sudden system shutdowns due to power cuts, or something else, the cache data can get corrupted and cause issues like the one at hand.

 To fix this issue, you will have to [clear the Discord cache](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/discord-users-free-up-disk-space/) on your computer.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## 4\. Reinstall Discord

 The error message can also occur due to an issue in the Discord installation files. You can fix this by reinstalling Discord.

 To do that, first [uninstall the app on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/) and restart your computer. Then, visit the [Discord download page](https://discord.com/download) and install it on your device.

## 5\. Contact Discord Support

 Are you still facing the issue? If yes, that means this is probably an issue with your Discord account. In this case, the only solution is to reach out to the [Discord support](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us) team and ask them to resolve the issue.
