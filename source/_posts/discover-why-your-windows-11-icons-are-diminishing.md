## Discover Why Your Windows 11 Icons Are Diminishing

 Do you remember that desktop shortcut icon being a little bit bigger than it is now? You're not going crazy. There's a rare bug in Windows 11 that may affect the size of your desktop icons. Here's how to fix it.

 If you've noticed your icons seem to be getting smaller, there's a good chance you're running a device with a high resolution, or non-standard DPI settings.

 This bug occurs mostly upon changing resolution or when DPI settings are automatically adjusted. It affects non-Windows app icons exclusively, which means you have to have a keen eye if you're [using customized icons in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/customize-icon-windows/).

 The quick fix for this issue is to clear the icon cache. It's as easy as finding and deleting some files. Open up the AppData folder by typing **%appdata%** into the top field of an explorer window. Then, navigate to the **Local** folder.

 The file titled **IconCache.db** is the first file we'll need to delete.

 Next, click into the **Microsoft** folder, then **Windows,** and finally **Explorer**. There will be a large number of files with the extension **.db**. Delete all of these files.

[Make sure you have file extensions turned on](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-see-file-extensions/), so you know which files to delete, as you don't want to delete anything but the .db files.

 Now restart your computer. Your icon cache will rebuild itself and your icons should be fixed.

 Unfortunately, it's not currently possible to permanently fix this error. Microsoft may notice this error and fix it in the future, but for now, the best way to keep your icons from shrinking is to avoid switching resolutions too much.

[You can also make sure that your DPI settings are set to the recommended scale](https://www.makeuseof.com/change-display-dpi-windows-11/) and keep an eye out for anything that might be automatically changing it.
