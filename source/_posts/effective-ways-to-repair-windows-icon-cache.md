## Effective Ways to Repair Windows Icon Cache

 Windows maintains a cache database where it stores every icon image it displays. This way, Windows does not have to retrieve the icon file from the source repeatedly. As you might expect, this process helps Windows save valuable resources.

 It is not uncommon for this icon cache database to become corrupted over time. When this happens, Windows may fail to display icons correctly on your computer. Fortunately, you can fix such issues quite easily by rebuilding the icon cache on Windows.

 In this post, we'll explore a couple of different ways to rebuild the icon cache on Windows.
