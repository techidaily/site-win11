## Eliminating Dark Screen Glitches in Windows Steam

## What Causes the Black Screen Issue on Steam?

 The display may go black on Steam for a variety of reasons. Here are a few of them:

1. The Steam client hasn't been updated for a long time.
2. Steam's settings have been configured incorrectly.
3. Other gaming clients or apps running alongside Steam are disrupting its operation.
4. Your graphics card is not working correctly due to a hardware issue, or you have overloaded it.
5. Some Steam client files have been corrupted.
6. The Steam cache or browser data has accumulated too much.

 With the above causes in mind, let's discuss the fixes you can apply to restore Steam's normal operation.

### 1\. Apply Some Basic Fixes

 To ensure that the black screen issue on Steam isn't just a minor glitch, first try these simple fixes:

* Restart the Steam client and your computer once to ensure that there are no temporary issues.
* Click three times anywhere on the black screen that appears in Steam.
* If you can see it, click on the**Friends & Chat** option in the bottom-right corner of the Steam client.  
![Click on the Friends and Chat Option in Steam Client](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1-click-on-the-friends-and-chat-option-in-steam-client.jpg)
* If you are encountering this issue when running Steam on an external monitor, move the Steam window to your main screen.

* Taking part in the Steam beta can also cause issues with display and other aspects of the game. Therefore, if you have recently joined the Steam beta version, you should opt out. We have covered the process to opt out of Steam beta in our guide on[fixing the Steam clients' crashing and freezing issues](https://www.makeuseof.com/steam-client-crashing-troubleshooting/#opt-out-of-the-steam-beta) .
* If you're using any hacking tools, cheat software, or other apps that could interfere with Steam's processing, turn them off.

 If the issue persists after applying the above fixes, apply the remaining fixes.

### 2\. Ensure Your Graphics Card Is Working Properly

 GPU problems account for most display issues. Therefore, before applying other fixes, you should ensure there is no hardware problem with your graphics card.

 Does your screen flicker or appear black and blurry in other games and software too? Do you sometimes see horizontal and vertical lines on it? If so, it's likely your GPU is malfunctioning. Therefore, get it checked by a technician. Before you do that,[update your graphics driver](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/) once to rule out software issues.

 However, if the issue only occurs when opening Steam, apply the next fix.

### 3\. Update the Steam Client

 Many users have commented on a[Steam community thread](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/discussions/3/1629664606996199530/) that updating the Steam client fixes the issue under discussion. So, you should give it a try. Follow these steps to update the Steam client:

1. Launch the Steam client.
2. Navigate to the**Steam** tab in the top-left corner.
3. Click on**Check for Steam Client Updatesâ€¦**  
![Click on the Check for Steam Client Updates Option in Steam Menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-click-on-the-check-for-steam-client-updates-option-in-steam-menu.jpg)
4. If the Steam client is already up-to-date, you'll see a message,**"Your Steam client is already up-to-date."**  

![Notification Window Showing the Steam Client is Already Up-to-date](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3-notification-window-showing-the-steam-client-is-already-up-to-date.jpg)
5. If Steam's client isn't already updated, download and install the latest update.

### 4\. Clear the Steam Web Browser Data

 According to some Steam users who have experienced the black screen problem, clearing the Steam web browser data fixes this issue. Clearing the browser data clears Steam's cached files, cookies, and history, which may fix the problem. To clear Steam web browser data, follow these steps:

1. Launch the Steam client.
2. Navigate to the**Steam** tab in the top-left corner and click on**Settings** .  
![Go to Settings Option in Steam Client](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/4-go-to-settings-option-in-steam-client.jpg)
3. Go to the**Web Browser** tab in the left sidebar.

4. Click**Delete Web Browser** **Data** in the right pane.

5. Click**OK** .

### 5\. Delete the Steam App Cache Folder

 Like most other applications and software, Steam retains some temporary data in its cache, which helps the client run more smoothly. However, if you don't clear this data regularly, it can affect Steam's performance.

 If you haven't cleared the Steam cache for ages, clear it, as it may fix the problem. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Open File Explorer.
2. Unless you changed the default install location, navigate to the following path:  
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`
3. Find the**appcache** folder.
4. Right-click on it and click**Delete** .

### 6\. Change Steam Client Settings

 Have you made any adjustments to Steam settings and encountered this issue afterward? In case you remember those changes, you should go back and reverse them. If you haven't made any tweaks recently, follow these steps:

1. Launch the Steam client.
2. Navigate to the**Steam** tab in the top-left corner and click on**Settings** .  
![Go to Settings Option in Steam Client](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/7-go-to-settings-option-in-steam-client.jpg)
3. Go to the**Library** tab, set the Library UI elements' display size to**Automatic** , and uncheck the box beside**Low Performance Mode** .

4. After that, go to the**Interface** tab. Select**< default skin >** from the dropdown menu if you use a different skin. In addition, disable**Big Picture Mode** if it's enabled, disable**GPU accelerated rendering** , and uncheck the**DirectWrite** option.

5. Lastly, uncheck the box beside**Enable Shader Pre-Caching** in the**Shader Pre-Caching** tab.  
![Uncheck the Box Besides Enable Shader Pre-Caching in the Shader Pre-Caching Tab of the Steam Client](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/10-uncheck-the-box-besides-enable-shader-pre-caching-in-the-shader-pre-caching-tab-of-the-steam-client.jpg)
6. Restart Steam after making the above changes.

### 7\. Close Steam Client WebHelper Process

 Many users in a[Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/3oyu4m/steam%5Fstore%5Fetc%5Fis%5Fnot%5Floading%5Fblack%5Fscreen/) have mentioned that force closing the Steam Client WebHelper or SteamWebHelper.exe process in Task Manager fixes the black display problem on Steam. This process is directly related to the display of Steam tabs. Any time there is a problem with this process, you will see display issues on Steam.

 So, if none of the previously suggested fixes worked for you, try this one. To disable it, type**"Task Manager"** in Windows Search and open the**Task Manager** application. Then, locate the**Steam Client WebHelper** or**SteamWebHelper.exe** process. After you've found it, right-click on it and click**End task** .

 It is safe to disable this process since Steam reinitiates it when you run the Steam client again. So, close this process, restart the Steam client, and hopefully, the display will return to normal.
