## How to Unravel WinError: Incorrect File Backups in Windows

 File History is a nifty feature on Windows that allows you to back up your important files and folders to an external drive. Although the feature works as expected most of the time, it can occasionally trouble you with errors like the “We found errors in your File History settings” on Windows.

 Let’s see how you can resolve this error and get the File History feature to work again on Windows.

## 1\. Restart the File History Service

 File History Service is a small program that needs to be running in the background for the File History feature to work. If this service is experiencing any problems, you could run into the "We found errors in your File History settings" error. In most cases, you can fix any temporary issues with File History Service by simply restarting it.

To restart the File History Service in Windows:

1. Right-click on the**Start icon** and select**Run** from the resulting menu.
2. Type**services.msc** in the text box and press**Enter** .
3. In the Services windows, scroll down to locate**File History Service** . Right-click on it and select**Restart** . If the service is not running, select**Start** .

## 2\. Disconnect and Reconnect the Backup Drive

 Connection problems with your external drive can also cause Windows to display the "We found errors in your File History settings" error. If it’s nothing major, you should be able to resolve the error by disconnecting and reconnecting your backup drive.

 While you're at it, try using a different USB port. This will help you determine if there’s a [problem with the USB port](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/dead-usb-port-heres-how-to-diagnose-and-fix-it/) you’re using. If you suspect a port is malfunctioning, check out how to diagnose and fix a faulty USB port on Windows.

## 3\. Re-Select the Backup Drive and Restart File History

 Next, you can try re-selecting your backup drive in File History settings and see if that helps. Here are the steps for the same.

1. Press**Win + R** or use one of the [many ways to open the Run dialog box](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) .
2. Type**control** in the box and press**Enter** .
3. Click the**View by** drop-down menu and select**Large icons** .

 If the error message persists even after this, you can try using a different drive for the File History backup and see if that works.

## 4\. Reset File History

 In order to delete File History data files, you’ll have to ensure that your PC is configured to [show hidden files and folders on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-show-hidden-files-folders/) . Here’s how to check.

2. Type**File Explorer Options** in the search box and press**Enter** .
3. Switch to the**View** tab and check the**Show hidden files, folders, and drives** option.
4. Hit**Apply** followed by**OK** .
