 If you want an easy way to view the schedule for your loan, you can create an amortization table in Microsoft Excel. We'll show you several templates that make creating this schedule easy so that you can track your loan.

##  What Is an Amortization Schedule?

 An [amortization schedule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization%5Fschedule.asp), sometimes called an amortization table, displays the amounts of principal and interest paid for each of [your loan payments](https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-deciphering-the-world-of-augmented-reality-stickers-googles-role/). You can also see how much you still owe on the loan at any given time with the outstanding balance after a payment is made.

 This allows you to see the entire loan from start to finish. It's beneficial for auto, personal, and home loans, and can help you see the results of extra payments you make or consider making.

 With an amortization schedule template for Microsoft Excel, you can enter the basic loan details and view the entire schedule in just minutes.
