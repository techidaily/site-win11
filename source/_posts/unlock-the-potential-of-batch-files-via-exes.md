## Unlock the Potential of Batch Files via EXEs

 While both Batch and EXE files help you execute programs on your PC, you might find yourself in situations where you can run specific files only in the EXE format. For example, the EXE files can execute many more commands than the Batch files. Moreover, it's also pretty tidy when you can simply consolidate your scattered Batch files into a single, compact .exe format.

 In what follows, that's precisely what we're going to cover. We’ll look at the top two ways to convert your Batch files into an EXE format, and lay out the process for you.

## Convert Your Batch Files Into an EXE File

 Now, there are two broad ways to go about it. First, you can rely on a handy converter and let it convert your BAT files to EXE file. But, if you’re more of a do-it-yourself person, you can also go the manual way. Let’s dive into using the in-built Windows tool first.

## Convert Your Batch Files to EXE with IExpress

[IExpress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IExpress) is a free Windows program, in use since Windows 2000, specifically designed to create self-extracted packages. This is what makes it super handy for converting your Batch (BAT) files into EXE ones as well.

To launch the IExpress app, follow the steps below:

1. Head to the**Start menu** search bar, and type in ‘iexpress’. From the best match, right-click on iexpress.exe and run it as administrator.
2. As soon as you do this, the IExpress Wizard will be launched. Choose the**Create new Self Extraction Directive (SED)** radio box from there, and click on**Next** .
3. Pick the**Extract files** **and run an installation command** radio box from the**Package purpose** window, and click on**Next** .

4. Enter a name for the**Package** **title** and hit**Next** again.  
![package title](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/package-title.JPG)
5. Select**No prompt** and hit**Next** .
6. Select**Do not display** **a license** and click on**Next** .
7. Click on**Add** to select the batch script you want to convert, and click on the**Next** button.
8. From the**Install Program** field, type in the following command and hit**Next** :  
cmd /c Calculator.bat

![install program to launch](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/install-program-to-launch.JPG)

 In our example, we're converting a Batch file that contains a simple calculator. Therefore, in the command_cmd /c Calculator.bat_ , the name of our batch file is '_Calculator.bat_ '. Since your Batch file will be likely different, make sure you change the command accordingly.

 Stick with the default option in the**Show window** and**Finished message** menu, and click**Next** . Now, in the**Package Name and Options** menu, select**Browse** to pick a target path, name the file anything you’d like, and click on**Next** . In the following few pages, click on**Next** without changing anything.

 Finally, on the**Create package** page, click on**Next** again. That’s it, folks. Your EXE package will be created in a few minutes. All you’ve to do from there is to head to the destination folder and launch the file for verifying.

## How to Convert Batch Files to EXE With a Converter

 While IExpress is more than enough to get the job done, not everyone wants to bother with the technical complexity it brings. Don't worry; you’re not alone in feeling that way. This is exactly why some clever people have developed tools to help you[easily automate your tasks](https://www.makeuseof.com/easily-automate-tasks-useful-tools/) on Windows.

 There’s a host of Batch to EXE converters out there. So, while we're not going to recommend any specific tool to you, for this example, we will use the[BAT to EXE Converter](https://bat-to-exe-converter-x64.en.softonic.com/download) . To get started with the Batch to EXE files converter, follow the steps below:

1. Download the free**BAT to EXE Converter** and install it on your PC.
2. After you've launched the tool, click on**Open** and select the batch file you’d like to convert.
3. Next, click on**Convert** and give a name to the location of your file.
4. Finally, click on**Save** .

 Again, your Batch files should be converted into an EXE in a few minutes. Launch the .exe file, and your program should execute effortlessly.

## Converting Batch Files to EXEs on Windows

 Converting your BAT files to .exe files doesn’t have to be complicated.

The tool we've suggested above, BAT to EXE Converter, is only one of many; there are many out there to pick from. So make sure you do your research and choose the one most suited to your computer.
