## Unlock More Disk Room with This Roundup of Cheap Volume Enhancers

 Sometimes, the maximum volume offered by your speakers doesn't seem to be enough. Or perhaps it's your headphones that are the problem, leaving you stuck with a barely audible sound. If you are stuck in a situation even somewhat similar to this, you'd love a volume booster.

 Volume boosters apps amplify sounds beyond the maximum limit through various algorithms. There are many options to pick from, so we have gone through the trenches to give you some of the best volume boosters out there.

## 1\. Equalizer APO

 Equalizer APO is one of the best open-source volume boosters for Windows users out there. The app is heavy on the technical side and demands some tech chops, but you should be fine if you know what you're doing.

 The app offers unlimited filters, compatibility with multiple channels, low latency, and CPU usage—making it a perfect choice for all your boosting needs. When you first launch it, the app asks you to configure the devices you'd like to boost the volume for your speakers, headphones, and so on.

 Finally, from there, you can use features like Preamplification, Graphic EQ, etc., to make the most out of the app.

**Download:**[Equalizer APO](https://equalizerapo.com/) (Free)

## 2\. FxSound

 We have mentioned FXSound before in our guide on [the best sound equalization tools on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-sound-equalizers/). But apart from its excellent equalization capabilities, the app also offers other features like boosting your sound volume and quality.

 It does this by improving the sound quality through a 32-bit floating processing and 16-bit re-dithering. Finally, since you've already improved the quality, you can now boost the sound as much as possible through dynamic boost and increase the sound without any quality loss. You can also improve Parametric EQ to boost bass.

 Best of all, the app is free, so you can try it out for as long as you like.

**Download:**[FXSound](https://www.fxsound.com/) \[Free\]

## 3\. DeskFX Audio Enhancer

![deskfx](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/deskfx.jpg)

 DeskFX Audio Enhancer offers a host of audio settings like equalize, amplify, reverb, chorus, and so on, all working to help you boost your sound quality and volume.

 This helps you increase the volume without sacrificing your sound quality. DeskFX Audio Enhancer also works with almost all the popular apps like Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, your movies, games, and so on—making it a good choice if you want an app you can use in various places.

 The app is available for free, but to access all the features, you will need to purchase the full version of the product.

**Download:**[DeskFX Audio Enhancer](https://www.nchsoftware.com/deskfx/index.html) \[Free, paid version available\]

## 4\. VLC Media Player

![vlc media player](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/vlc-media-player.jpg)

 Perhaps a surprising addition to this list for many, VLC media player is widely popular as a general media player, and we crowned it one of the [best free media players for Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/top-5-free-media-players-for-windows/). However, you can also use the app to boost your volume.

 In fact, the app has in-built volume boosters that can boost up your device's sound up to 125% without a dip in the sound quality. In fact, many users who've been using the VLC media player's volume booster aren't even aware that they are using a tool that's absent in other music players, for which they might otherwise need a unique tool to do this.

 However, since VLC is a media player that plays your sound and video files, it suffices to say that the app's volume-boosting capabilities are limited to boosting your video and audio files only.

 To amplify the sound on VLC, you have to simply slide the volume slider to the maximum, and the app will do the rest. By default, the limit is set to 125%. You can increase this limit up to 300% with some tweaks in the settings, but this comes at the cost of your sound quality.

**Download:**[VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) \[Free\]

## 5\. Viper4Windows

 Viper4Windows is a full-service audio management app that makes use of a variety of self-reliant audio-processing algorithms. This lets the app tinker with system volume across a variety of channels—video chats, music players, videos, radio, and so on.

 The app is free, and you can use it on all versions of Windows from Vista onward.

**Download:**[Viper4Windows](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Audio/Other-AUDIO-Tools/ViPER4Windows.shtml) \[Free\]

## 6\. Chrome Volume Booster

![chrome volume booster](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chrome-volume-booster.jpg)

 If you're someone who likes to turn the volume up every once in a while, the options we've laid out above will do the job for you quite easily. But if you're looking for something that blasts your speakers during your internet browsing sessions, you're going to need something much more powerful. Chrome Volume Booster is filling the role for you here.

 All you have to do is download and install the Chrome extension and slide the single slider, and that's it. This will help you boost the sound without any hiccups; the only caveat is that you can only use this app on your Chrome browser, so you will be severely restricted in other aspects. But if you're okay with that, this app can do the job well on your browser.

**Download:** [Chrome Volume Booster](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/volume-booster/ejkiikneibegknkgimmihdpcbcedgmpo) \[Free\]

## 7\. Letasoft Sound Booster

## The Best Sound Boosting Apps for a Windows PC

 Sometimes, you might have to boost your PC's sound simply because of speaker problems, etc. Other times you might want loud music that your default speakers fail to offer. Whatever the case, if you go by the default method, you can only increase your computer's up to a specific limit.

 However, try one of our suggested apps above, and you will boost your sound levels above and beyond the usual limits without any hassles.

 Volume boosters apps amplify sounds beyond the maximum limit through various algorithms. There are many options to pick from, so we have gone through the trenches to give you some of the best volume boosters out there.
