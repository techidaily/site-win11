 Some users have posted on web forums seeking assistance for fixing Microsoft Store error code 0x80073CF3\. The 0x80073CF3 error can sometimes occur when users try to download and install certain apps (typically games) with the Microsoft Store. That error code’s message says, “The update failed.”

## 1\. Run the Windows Store Apps Troubleshooting Tool

## 2\. Clear the Microsoft Store’s Cache

 Some Microsoft Store users who’ve needed to fix error 0x80073CF3 have confirmed running the "wsreset" command can work. Wsreset is a command specifically for clearing (or resetting) the Microsoft Store’s cached data. Our article about [resetting the Microsoft Store](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-11-reset-microsoft-store/) tells you how to execute this handy command in Windows 10 and 11\.

## 3\. Reset the Microsoft Store App

 Windows Settings also includes a **Reset** option for the Microsoft Store. Selecting **Reset** is a similar fix to running the wsreset command, but it’s a more general option for clearing all Microsoft Store’s data. As such, if the wsreset command is ineffective, try performing a reset instead. You can apply this solution by following the instructions within our guide on [how to reset apps in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-reset-app/).

## 4\. Repair the Gaming Services App

 A few users who’ve needed to fix error 0x80073CF3 for their Microsoft Store game apps have confirmed that repairing Gaming Services can resolve the issue. Gaming Services is a Microsoft Store app required by Xbox Game Pass apps on Microsoft’s storefront. To do so, select the **Repair** option for Gaming Services in Settings, as covered within our [guide to repairing apps in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-repair-apps-programs/).

 If you don’t have the Gaming Services app, you may need it to download and install certain games from the Microsoft Store without issues.

## 5\. Turn Off Any Active Antivirus Apps

 Antivirus apps can sometimes interfere with the downloading and installing of legitimate apps. This can happen when an antivirus utility wrongly flags an app.

 To eliminate such a potential cause, try turning off any third-party antivirus tool on your PC. The usual way to do that is to right-click an antivirus system tray icon and select a context menu setting for temporarily disabling its shied for a few hours. Then select to download/install the Microsoft Store apps for which error 0x80073CF3 occurs with the antivirus software deactivated.

 Windows also has a pre-installed antivirus tool. If you don’t have third-party antivirus software, you can try disabling the Microsoft Defender antivirus component. Our guide to [disabling Microsoft Defender](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-turn-off-windows-defender/) tells you how to turn it off.

![The real-time protection setting for Microsoft Defender](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/real-time-protection-setting.jpg)

## 6\. Set Windows to Perform a Clean Boot

 The description for error 0x80073CF3 hints that a software (or app) conflict can cause this issue to arise. Setting Windows to clean boot could eliminate such a potential software conflict. Applying that potential fix will disable all unnecessary third-party startup items from running automatically.

![The System Configuration window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/system-configuration-window.jpg)

 You can configure a clean boot by selecting to disable third-party startup programs and services with Task Manager and System Configuration. Our guide to [performing a clean boot on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/) includes full guidelines for how to disable startup items with those tools. Then restart your PC and try downloading the required Microsoft Store apps again to see if error 0x80073CF3 continues.

## 7\. Free Up Some Drive Storage Space
