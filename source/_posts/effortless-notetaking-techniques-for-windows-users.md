## 1\. Use Notepad

![Windows 11 Notepad in dark mode](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/windows-11-notepad-in-dark-mode.jpg)

 Notepad is a long-term favorite for offline note-taking on your PC. Its simplicity is liked by many, although since the release of Windows 11, Notepad has added some extra features to aid your writing experience. Notepad now offers dark mode support and options to change the font style and size.

 Opening Notepad in Windows 11 is simple. The app is pre-installed on all Windows devices. Hit the **Windows** key to open the Start menu, then search for “Notepad.”

 If you use the app often, you can create a desktop shortcut for faster access. Navigate to the Start menu, hit **All Apps**, and find Notepad down the alphabetical list. Then drag the app to a space on the desktop to create a shortcut. You can also access Notepad faster by [pinning an app to the Windows 11 Taskbar](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-taskbar-pin-almost-anything/).

![WordPad blank document demonstrating formatting features](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wordpad-blank-document-demonstrating-formatting-features.jpg)

 WordPad is another pre-installed app offering a great method to take notes without downloading software. The app’s simple design resembles Notepad but offers more advanced features—notably its rich text editor—to upgrade your note-taking.

 With its rich text editor, you can change the font color and style, add bulleted lists, and highlight text. WordPad also offers a feature to send documents directly as an email. Hit **File** and select **Send as email**.

 To access the app, go to the Start menu and search for “WordPad.” Files can be saved as a plain text file (as used in Notepad) or as a rich text document (.rtf) if you’d like to import your notes into other software.

 You can access the clipboard at any point by using the shortcut **Ctrl + V**. For the most important pieces of information, you can pin notes by hitting the small pin icon. Now, you no longer have to remember bits of information while browsing online.
