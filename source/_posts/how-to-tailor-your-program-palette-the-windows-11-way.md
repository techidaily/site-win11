## How To Tailor Your Program Palette: The Windows 11 Way

 If you are not satisfied with any of the default apps assigned by Windows, you can change them to your preferred options. This process was quite simple in Windows 10, but Microsoft has made it a bit complicated for Windows 11 users.

 In this guide, we will discuss the method of changing the default apps in Windows 11 in detail. We have also discussed several troubleshooting methods later in this guide that you can try if the default apps fail to change.

## How to Change the Default Apps in Windows 11

[Changing the default apps in Windows 10](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/change-default-settings-windows-10/) is quite simple. You can access the**Default Apps** section of the Settings app and replace the current default app with your preferred option.

 In Windows 11, this method is slightly different. You must set a program default for all the registered file types and links relevant to it since there isnâ€™t a**Set default for all** option available.

 Below, we have listed different ways of changing the default apps in Windows 11:

### 1\. Choose the Open With Option

 The easiest method of changing the default apps option is by using the Open with option in the context menu for files.

Here is how you can do that:

1. Right-click on the targeted file. For instance, an image file that you want to open with an app other than the default Photos app.
2. Choose**Open with** \>**Choose another app** from the context menu.  
![Choose another app to open the targeted file](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-open-with-choose-another-app.jpg)
3. Now, in the following dialog, choose the app you want to set as the default option. If you cannot find the targeted app in the list, choose**Look for another app on this PC** and then select the app.
4. Click on**Always use this app to open files** and click**OK** . This should set the selected app as the default preference.

1. Press the Win + I keys together to open the Windows Settings.
2. Choose**Apps** from the left pane.
