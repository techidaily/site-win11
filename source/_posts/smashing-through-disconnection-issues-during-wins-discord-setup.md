## Smashing Through Disconnection Issues During Win's Discord Setup

 Discord is a widely-used social media platform where people make their own communities. However, some users can’t install Discordon Windows 10 and 11 because of a DiscordSetup.exe “Installation has failed” error. The issue often arises when users who’ve previously installed Discord try to reinstall the software.

 Is the “Installation has failed” error preventing you from installing and utilizing Discord in Windows? If so, you don’t have to miss out on Discord. This is how you can fix the “Installation has failed” error in Windows 10 and 11.

## 1\. Download the Discord Setup File Again

 First, try downloading the**DiscordSetup.exe** file again. This is suggested to double-check that the issue isn’t occurring because of a corrupted setup file. Click**Download for Windows** on the[Discord website](https://discord.com/download) to obtain a new installer for the software. Then try installing Discord with the fresh setup wizard.

 Note that there’s also an alternative Discord Public Test Build (PTB) version available on that download page. You can try installing the PTB, which includes new experimental features, as an alternative to the standard Discord client. To do so, click the**Download Public Test Build** option further down the page instead and select**Windows** .

## 2\. Run the Windows Troubleshooter for Installing and Uninstalling Programs

 The Microsoft Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter resolves issues blocking software installation by examining the registry. So, running the troubleshooter could feasibly be a solution for the “Installation has failed” error. You can download and open the Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter in the following steps:

1. Navigate to the[Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed-cca7d1b6-65a9-3d98-426b-e9f927e1eb4d) download webpage.
2. Click that page’s**Download** **troubleshooter** button.
3. Select File Explorer’s taskbar shortcut (the folder library icon), and bring up whatever directory contains the downloaded Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter file.
4. Double-click**MicrosoftProgram\_Install\_and\_Uninstall.meta.diagcab** to launch the troubleshooter.  
![The Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-program-install-and-uninstall-troubleshooter.jpg)
5. Select**Next** to go to the first step.
6. Click**Installing** to view a program list.
7. Select**Discord** if you can see that software on the list. If Discord isn’t there, click the**Not listed** option.

8. Then press**Next** again to start troubleshooting.

## 3\. Disable Any Background Discord Processes

 Some users have said disabling Discord background processes can resolve the issue. If you’ve previously installed and used the software, there could be some related background Discord processes or services that need disabling. This is how you can check for and disable Discord background processes in Windows 10 and 11:

1. [Launch Task Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-open-task-manager-windows-10/) by pressing**Win + X** and clicking its shortcut. Check out[how to launch Task Manager on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-open-task-manager-windows-10/) for more methods.
2. Click**Processes** if Task Manager opens with a different tab.
3. Look for Discord-related processes within the Background processes section.
4. Right-click any Discord process you find and select**End task** .  
![The End task option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/end-task-option.jpg)
5. Repeat the fourth step for all Discord-related processes.
6. Try installing Discord after disabling related background processes.

## 4\. Delete Any Leftover Discord Data Folders

 Erasing leftover Discord data is one of the most widely confirmed resolutions for the “Installation has failed” error (especially when combined with the third solution). That’s a potential fix more applicable to users who’ve previously installed Discord. If there are leftover Discord data folders on your PC, make sure you delete them as follows:

1. Open the Power User menu (right-click the**Start** icon), and select**Run** .  
![The Run shortcut on the Power User menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-run-option.jpg)
2. Type**%appdata%** into Run and click**OK** to bring up a Roaming directory.
3. Right-click a Discord data folder in the Roaming directory to select**Delete** .  
![The Delete option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-delete-option.jpg)
4. Launch**Run** again, and input**%localappdata%** inside its**Open** box.
5. Select**OK** to view a Local folder.
6. Right-click a Discord data folder there if you can find one and select**Delete** .

## 5\. Run the Discord Setup File as an Administrator

 Running the Discord setup file as an administrator will ensure the installer has fuller system access, which might make a difference. To do so, open whatever folder includes the**DiscordSetup.exe** file. Then right-click**DiscordSetup.exe** to select its**Run as administrator** option.

## 6\. Install the .NET Framework on Windows

 Discord’s “Installation has failed” error can occur because the .NET Framework is missing. If something has happened to .NET Framework on your PC, you may need to install it again. This is how to install .NET Framework 4.5 on Windows:

1. Open this[Microsoft .NET Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=30653) page.
2. Select .NET Framework’s**Download** option.
3. Bring up the directory containing the downloaded**dotNetFx45\_Full\_setup.exe** file in Explorer.
4. Double-click**dotNetFx45\_Full\_setup** to open the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 window.  
![The Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 installer window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-microsoft-net-framework-installer-window.jpg)
5. Click**Continue** if that option isn’t grayed out.

 If .NET Framework isn’t missing, there could still be an issue with that framework. You can instead try to repair it by running the .NET Framework Repair Tool. Check out our guide about[repairing .NET Framework](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-repair-net-framework/) for more details.

## 7\. Turn Off Antivirus Utilities Before Installing Discord

 It’s not entirely unusual for antivirus utilities to cause third-party software installation issues. Antivirus apps are designed to block malware from installing, but can sometimes confuse legitimate third-party software packages to be something they aren’t. So, it’s recommended users turn off antivirus shields before attempting to install Discord.

![The Real-time protection setting in the Windows Security app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/windows-security-app.jpg)

 You can turn off the Windows Security real-time protection by following the instructions in our[how to disable Microsoft Defender](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-turn-off-microsoft-defender-windows-11/) article. If you’ve got third-party antivirus software installed, right-click its icon within the system tray to select an option for temporarily disabling the shield. You can also probably find a disable shield option within its settings tab.

## 8\. Try Installing Discord in Safe Mode

 Some background third-party apps and drivers can also feasibly generate Discord installation issues. So, it’s also possible something in the background other than antivirus software could be causing the “Installation has failed” installation error on your PC. You can eliminate such a potential cause by installing Discord in the Windows safe mode, which disables superfluous background apps and drivers.

![windows 11 startup settings safe mode](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/windows-11-startup-settings-safe-mode.jpg)

 There are numerous ways to enter safe mode in Windows. You can do so with any of the methods in our guide for[how to enter safe mode on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-boot-safe-mode/) . Select the**Enable Safe Mode with Networking** option on the Startup Settings menu. Then download Discord again and try installing it in safe mode.
