## Revive Hidden Bluetooth in Windows System

 There are plenty of uses for Bluetooth on your computer. You can connect your headphones, speaker, keyboard, or any other device. You can even share files with nearby devices. So, if Bluetooth is missing from Device Manager, you’ll have a hard time managing your Bluetooth devices.

 If this has happened to you, there’s no need to fret, as one or more of the below solutions will help you bring Bluetooth back to Device Manager.

## 1\. Show Hidden Devices

 There’s a chance Bluetooth is not missing from Device Manager, but Windows somehow decided to hide it from the list.

 To check for hidden devices, launch Device Manager and open the**View** menu. There, click**Show hidden devices** and check if Bluetooth is now visible. If you still can’t find it, move on to the next fixes.

## 2\. Reconnect the Bluetooth Adapter

 If you’ve connected a Bluetooth dongle as a[way to add Bluetooth to your computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/bluetooth-adapter-for-pc/) , the driver might be missing because of faulty hardware. Reconnect the adapter or try another USB port and check if it’s now showing in Device Manager.

 Additionally, try to connect it to another computer to determine if the adapter is still working or if you should buy a new one.

## 3\. Update USB Drivers

 If the Bluetooth adapter is working on another computer, your issue might be caused by an outdated or corrupt USB driver.

 Open Device Manager and expand the**Universal Serial Bus controllers** list. There, right-click the driver and select**Update driver** . Windows will search for a compatible driver version and install it.

## 4\. Check Flight Mode

 On a Windows computer, enabling Flight Mode is a quick way to disable wireless communications such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or NFC. So if there’s something wrong with Flight Mode on your computer, it could cause Bluetooth drivers to miss from Device Manager.

 Launch Action Center and check if Flight Mode is turned off. If it’s already turned off, enable it for a couple of minutes and turn it off again. If you can’t turn it on and off from Action center, there are more[ways to control Flight Mode on a Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-turn-airplane-mode-on-or-off-windows-11/) .

## 5\. Run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter

 If Bluetooth is still missing from Device Manager, you should use the built-in Bluetooth troubleshooter to fix the problem.

1. Press**Windows key + I** to bring up Windows Settings.
2. Go to**System > Troubleshoot > Other trouble-shooters** .
3. From the**Other** list, click**Run** next to**Bluetooth** .

## 6\. Run an SFC Scan

 Bluetooth could be missing from Device Manager because a system file associated with its functionality got corrupted or damaged. Running the System File Checker should fix these files.

 To do this, use one of the[ways to open Windows Search](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-search-use-guide/) to bring it up. Search for**command prompt** and select**Run as administrator** . Then, type the**sfc /scannow** command line and press**Enter** . Make sure you don’t close Command Prompt until the scan is not complete, so Windows can detect and replace any corrupt or damaged files.

## 7\. Check Bluetooth Service

 While the Bluetooth service is running in the background and usually requires no attention, sometimes it could malfunction, causing Device Manager to stop showing Bluetooth drivers. In this case, you should take a look at the Bluetooth service.

 In the Start menu search bar, search for**services** and select**Run as administrator** . Then, in the**Services** window, locate and open**Bluetooth Support Service** .

 Take a look at its**Status** and check if it’s**Running** . If the service is already running, you can click**Stop > Start** to restart it.
