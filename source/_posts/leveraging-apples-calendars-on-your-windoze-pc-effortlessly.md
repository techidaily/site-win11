## 1\. Apple iCloud

[iCloud](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-icloud/) is an Apple service that keeps all your critical data on the cloud. It stores almost everything that's kept locally on your PC: Contacts, Pages, Reminders, etc.—it’s all there. You'll also find the Calendar app there, of course. So, if you want to access the Calendar app on Windows through iCloud, follow the steps below:

* Head to[iCloud.com](https://www.icloud.com/) and sign in to your Apple account.
* You'll get a sign-in confirmation on your Apple device. Click on**Allow** to go ahead with the sign-in.
* As soon as you click on**Allow** from above, you'll get a verification code. Note it down.
* Now head back to your Windows. You'll see a host of Apple apps here; click on**Calendar** .

 That’s it. Follow the above steps, and you’ll be inside the Calendar web app. You’ll get a view like this:

 Similarly, if you would like to set a new event, simply click on the**+** sign from the right corner. Enter all the relevant details like the Event name, location, time, date, etc., and you can create your event from here successfully.

 From the bottom-left corner, click on the**Settings** icon, and you’ll find a host of new settings that you can tweak. It includes everything from**Preferences** ,**New Event** ,**New Calendar** ,**Delete Event** ,**Go to Date** ,**Show Declined Events** , and so on. You can choose either of these, and you’ll be okay with the iCloud Calendar app.
