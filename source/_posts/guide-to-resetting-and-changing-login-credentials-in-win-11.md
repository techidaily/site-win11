## Guide to Resetting and Changing Login Credentials in Win 11

 Despite Microsoft’s attempt to push more users towards adopting the Windows Hello-based sign-in options, the old password-based login is still part of Windows 11\. And for a good reason.

 Even if you prefer a PIN over the conventional password sign-in, you can set an account password as a backup option. It is a handy way to sign in if you forget your PIN or encounter an error. But what if you have forgotten your account password? Let's explore the many ways to change your account password in Windows 11.

## What If You Have Forgotten Your Windows Administrator Password?

 Most Windows computers have more than one sign-in option. So, if your [Windows user account PIN isn’t working](https://www.makeuseof.com/something-happened-your-pin-isnt-available-windows/) , you can use the account password to sign in and vice versa.

 To be able to change your account password, you must either remember your current password or be able to log in to your PC with an alternate sign-in option. If you are locked out of your account without no option to sign in, follow our guide to [reset a forgotten Windows administrator password](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/3-ways-to-reset-the-forgotten-windows-administrator-password/) instead.

## 1\. Change the Account Password Using Ctrl + Alt + Delete

 Ctrl + Alt + Delete combo is often used if an app causes the PC to become unresponsive and if you want to perform a restart or access Task Manager. However, the combo offers access to other useful tools, including a password change option.

 Follow these steps to quickly change your account password from the Ctrl + Alt + Delete user menu:

1. Press**Ctrl + Alt + Delete** on your keyboard to view the available options.
2. Next, click on**Change** **a password** option.  
![ctrl alt delete change password](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ctrl-alt-delete-change-password.jpg)
3. Next, enter your old account password.
4. Next, you need to provide a new password and confirm the same.  
![ctrl alt delete change password new password](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ctrl-alt-delete-change-password-new-password.jpg)
5. Press**Enter** or click the right arrow icon to change the password.
6. It’s a quick way to change your account password. If this doesn’t work, you can use the Settings app to do the same.

## 2\. Change Your Account Password via the Settings App

 You can easily change your local account password from the Settings app. However, to do this, you must know your current account password. If not, skip to the password reset method below.

To change the account password:

1. Press**Win + I** to open**Settings** .
2. In the left pane, open the**Accounts** tab.  
![change user account password settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/change-user-account-password-settings.jpg)

![change user account password settings new password](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/change-user-account-password-settings-new-password.jpg)
7. Next, enter your new password and re-enter the password to confirm the same.
8. You can also add a password hint. If not, leave it blank.
9. Click**Next** and then click on**Finish** to save the changes.

## 3\. Reset Windows User Account Password Using User Accounts (If You Have Forgotten Your Password)

 If you don’t know your current password but can log in using an alternate option, you can reset the password using the User Accounts utility. It allows you to add or remove a user account and reset the password without needing the current password.

 Note that you can only reset the password for a different user account, not your currently logged-in account. Make sure to log in with a different administrator account. If you don't have another account with administrator privilege, you can [enable the built-in administrator account in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-enable-disable-built-in-administrator-account/) and reset the user account password.

To reset the user account password:

1. Sign out from the account for which you want to reset the password and log in with a different user account.
2. Next, press**Win + R** to open**Run** .
3. Type**netplwiz** and click**OK** .
4. Select the user account to reset the password in the**User Accounts** dialog.

6. In the**Reset Password** dialog, enter your new password and confirm the same.
7. Click**OK** to save the changes.
8. Close the**User Account** dialog, and you can now log in with your new password.

## 4\. Reset Account Password Using Command Prompt

![reset user account password command prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/reset-user-account-password-command-prompt.jpg)

 An easy way to change your account password is via Command Prompt. Again, useful if you want to change your password without knowing the old password.

 To reset the password, you can use the**net user** command followed by the user name and your new password. Follow these steps to change your account password using Command Prompt:

1. Press**Win + X** to open the**WinX** menu.
2. Click on**Terminal (Admin)** from the menu. Click**Yes** if prompted by**UAC** .
3. In Windows Terminal, click the drop-down button near the**New Tab** icon and select**Command Prompt.**
4. In the Command Prompt tab, type the following command and press**Enter** to view all the user accounts available on your computer:  
`net user`
5. Next, type the following command and press**Enter** to reset the password for the specified user account:  
`net user username newpassword`

1. In the above command, replace**username** with the account username and**newpassword** with the password you want to set.
2. For example, if you want to reset the password for the**Guest** user account, the complete command will look something like this:  
`net user guest guest@123`
3. Make sure to use a password with a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and preferably special characters to create a strong password. You may also want to note it down for the time being.
4. Once the password is reset, you’ll see the**command completed successfully** message in Command Prompt.
5. Type**exit** and press**Enter** to close Command Prompt.

## 5\. Change the Account Password Using the Control Panel

 The classic Control Panel still has most of its system setting functions intact. You can use it in Windows 11 to change your user account password and more.

To change the Windows account password using Control Panel:

1. Press**Win + R** to open**Run** .
2. Type**control** and click**OK** .
3. In Control Panel, go to**User Accounts** and then click on**User Accounts** again.
