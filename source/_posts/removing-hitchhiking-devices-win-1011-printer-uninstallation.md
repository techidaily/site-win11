 Often, you will need to remove and reconnect your printer for troubleshooting purposes. Also, removing old and unused devices helps you keep your connected device list organized in Windows 11 and 10\.

 You can remove any connected printer from the Settings panel. If that does not work, you can use the Command Prompt and other ways to remove the printer. Here, we show you the many ways to delete a printer on Windows computers.
