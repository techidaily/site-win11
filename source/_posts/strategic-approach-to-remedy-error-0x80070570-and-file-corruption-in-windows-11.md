You’ll need to run the Check Disk scan for the drive that includes the files you can’t delete or copy to. If that’s an external drive, you’ll need to connect the storage device to the PC and specify its letter within the command. For example, a CHKDSK command for scanning an external E: drive would be:

`chkdsk /r E:`
