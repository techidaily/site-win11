## Mastering Access to Windows' ODBC Settings

 The Microsoft ODBC Data Sources tool helps you connect your apps to various database management systems. But how does this tool work, and what are the different ways to access it? Let's dive in and find out.

## How Does the ODBC Data Sources App Work?

![An illustration of a question and an idea](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/An-illustration-of-a-question-and-an-idea.jpg)

 ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) is a system that connects apps to database management systems. For example, if you use an app that accesses data in an SQL database, the ODBC Data Sources tool lets you connect that app to a different data source (such as Microsoft Excel).

 Let's now check out how you can use the ODBC Data Sources tool:

* Press **Win + R** to open the Run command dialog box.
* Type **odbcad32.exe** and press **Enter**.  
![Accessing the ODBC Data Sources app using the Run command dialog box](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/accessing-the-odbc-data-sources-app-using-the-run-command-dialog-box.jpg)
* Navigate to the **User DSN** tab.

 A DSN establishes a connection to a target database through an ODBC driver. It can also help you pull information from a database.

* Click the **Add** button on the right to start creating a User DSN.  
![Clicking the Add button on the ODBC Data Sources app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/clicking-the-add-button-on-the-odbc-data-sources-app.jpg)
* On the next screen, select the relevant ODBC driver and click the **Finish** button. From there, enter the details of your data source in the next window.
* Follow the on-screen steps and then click the **Finish** button.

 Once you've created a User DSN, you can explore some cool tricks with the ODBC tool. For example, you can check out how to connect your databases with VBScript by [creating a VBScript ODBC Connection](https://www.makeuseof.com/create-a-vb-script-odbc-connection/).
