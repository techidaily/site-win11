1. Visit [Microsoft’s official page](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11) to download Windows 11\.
2. Scroll down to the **Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) for X64 devices** section.
3. Click the drop-down menu and select **Windows 11 (multi-edition ISO)**.

![create windows 11 bootable usb drive with rufus](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/create-windows-11-bootable-usb-drive-with-rufus.png)

 Rufus is an open-source utility to format and create a bootable USB flash drive for the Windows operating system. It's a lightweight utility and offers a few more customization options compared to Microsoft's in-house media creation tool.

 To create a Windows 11 bootable USB drive using Rufus:

1. Visit the [Rufus website](https://rufus.ie/en/) and scroll down to the **Download** section.
2. Click on the **Rufus link** to download the latest version.
3. Run the executable file and click **Yes** if prompted by UAC.
4. Connect your USB flash drive to your PC and wait for Rufus to detect and show it under the **Device** section.
5. Click the drop-down for **Boot selection** and select **Disk or ISO image.**

1. Then, click the **SELECT** button.
2. Select the **Windows ISO** file and click **Open**.
3. Click the drop-down under the **Image option** and select **Standard Windows 11 Installation**.
4. Leave the **Partition scheme (GPT)** and **Target system (UEFI)** as default.
5. Under **Volume label**, enter a name for your bootable flash drive.
6. Leave the **File system** and **Cluster size,** and other options as default.
7. Make sure the **Quick format** and **Create extended label and icon files** option is checked.
8. Click the **Start** button to initiate the bootable drive creating process.

 Once done, Rufus will show a success message. Now you can use the [Windows 11 bootable drive to install the OS](http://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-11/) on any compatible system.

## 2\. How to Create a Windows 11 Bootable USB Drive Using the Media Creation Tool

 The media creation tool is Microsoft's in-house solution to create an installation media. You can use the media creation tool to create a bootable USB flash drive or download the ISO file to your local drive. Since it needs to download the ISO to create a bootable drive, you cannot use an existing Windows ISO image with this tool.

 To create an installation media using the media creation tool:

1. Connect your USB flash drive of at least 8GB to your PC. Make sure it is detected and you have taken a backup of all the files on your USB drive.
2. Next, visit the [Microsoft download center](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11) page.
3. Under the **Create Windows 11 Installation Media** section, click the **Download Now** button and save the file to your PC.
4. Next, run the **Mediacreationtool.exe** file and click **Yes** if prompted by UAC. The tool may take a few seconds to launch, so wait till you see the **Setup wizard.**
5. Click the **Accept button** to agree to the terms.

## 3\. How to Create a Bootable Drive Using Command Prompt

 If you don’t want to use a third-party tool to create a bootable drive, you can use the Diskpart utility and Command Prompt to create installation media. Here's how to do it.

1. First, take a backup of all the files on your USB drive and then connect it to your PC.
2. Press the **Win** key, type cmd, **and** click on **Run as Administrator** under **Command Prompt.** You can also use PowerShell if you prefer it over Command Prompt.  
![disk part windows 11 bootable drive](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/disk-part-windows-11-bootable-drive.png)
3. In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and hit enter to launch the **Windows Diskpart** utility.  
`DISKPART`
4. Next, type the following command to list all the available storage devices:  
`LIST DISK`
5. Here, locate your USB drive. You can look at the **Size column** to determine your USB drive. In this case, the USB drive is listed as **Disk 2.**

1. Next, type the following command to select your drive:  
`SEL DISK 2`
2. In the above command, change **DISK 2** with the number assigned to your USB drive. For example, if you have a single SSD or SATA drive setup, your primary drive will show as **DISK 0** and USB drive as **DISK 1**. It is of **extreme importance that you select the right drive** as the next step involves wiping clean the selected drive.
3. Once the drive is erased, type the following command and hit enter to erase all the content from the drive:  
`Clean`
4. Next, type the following command to create a primary partition:  
`Create Partition Primary`
5. After creating a primary partition, type the following command to select the main partition:  
`List Par`
6. Command Prompt will show the details of your USB drive.  
![format usb drive windows 11 cmd](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/format-usb-drive-windows-11-cmd.png)
7. Type the following command and hit enter to activate the partition:  
`Active`
8. Then type the following command to format the USB drive. It is important to format the drive in NTFS format as the [FAT32 format will cause the incorrect parameter error](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-fix-parameter-is-incorrect-error/).  
`FORMAT FS=NTFS LABEL=&ldquo;BootableUSB&rdquo; QUICK OVERRIDE`
9. Once done, type **Exit** and hit enter to exit the Disk Part utility.

 Now you will need to mount the ISO image and then move its content to your USB drive.

![mount ISO image Windows 11 Command Prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mount-ISO-image-Windows-11-Command-Prompt.png)

1. To do this, type the following command and hit **Enter** to mount the Windows 11 ISO file:  
`PowerShell Mount-DiskImage -ImagePath "C:\Users\UserName\Downloads\Win11_English_x64v1.iso"`
2. In the above command, replace the file path with the location of your Windows 11 ISO.

![cmd list volume](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cmd-list-volume.png)
3. Once the ISO is mounted, type the following command to launch Diskpart.  
`Diskpart`
4. Next, type the following command to show the available volume.  
`List volume`
5. This will help you determine the Drive letter for the mounted ISO file. In the **Type column**, the mounted ISO will be listed as **DVD-ROM**. And the **Ltr column** lists the letter associated with the volume. Note down the details of the ISO volume as you will be using it moving forward.

![list volume cmd windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/list-volume-cmd-windows-11.png)

1. Once you have the volume details for the mounted ISO, type the following command to exit Diskpart:  
`Exit`
2. Next, type the mounted ISO volume letter and hit enter. For example, if your mounted ISO volume letter is **J**, then type the following command and press Enter.  
`J:`
3. Type the following command to boot from CD:  
`cd boot`
4. Next, type the following command to apply the master boot code compatible with Bootmgr to the USB flash drive:  
`Bootsect /nt60 I:`
5. In the above command, replace **I** with the drive letter associated with your USB flash drive.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![copy iso files to usb drive](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/copy-iso-files-to-usb-drive.png)
6. Next, type the following command and hit Enter to copy Windows 11 system files to the USB flash drive:  
`xcopy J:\*.* I:\ /E /F /H`
7. In the above command, replace **K:** and **I:** with your **Mounted ISO Volume** and **USB drive** letter, respectively.
8. The process may take a 5-10 minutes to complete. If the Command Prompt feels stuck, it is normal behaviour, so wait until the process is complete.
9. If successful, you will see a **Files (s) Copied** message.

 That’s it. Now you can use the USB bootable drive to clean install Windows 11\.
