## Enhancing Window 11'S Secure Browsing Graphically

 Microsoft Edge's Application Guard is a stellar security feature, providing your device with malware defense while browsing the web. Even though this application offers great protection, the Advanced Graphics feature comes disabled by default.

 If you're seeking to experience smoother online navigation without sacrificing safety and privacy, then worry not! Microsoft has added an option allowing you to turn on advanced graphics in their Application Guard for Windows 11\. In this guide, we'll show you how to enable advanced graphics in Application Guard for Edge.

## 1\. How to Enable Advanced Graphics via Windows Settings

 The Settings app is a great way to quickly enable advanced graphics for your Application Guard in Microsoft Edge. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on Start and select**Settings** from the menu list. See our guide for more information on[how to access Windows Settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) .
2. Click**Privacy & security** in the left pane.
3. On the right, click**Windows Security** .
4. Click**App & browser control** on the next page.

7. If you see a UAC prompt, click**Yes** to continue.

 After you follow the above steps, close the Settings window and restart your computer. Application Guard will now be enabled with advanced graphics support. If you ever want to turn off this feature, just follow the same steps and turn off Advanced graphics.

## 2\. How to Enable Advanced Graphics via Registry Editor

 If you don't like the idea of tinkering with the Windows Settings page, you can also use the Registry Editor to enable advanced graphics in Application Guard for Edge. But keep in mind that tweaking the Windows Registry is a risky endeavor, so proceed carefully. To be safe,[back up your registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) before making any changes.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Press**Win + R** on your keyboard to open the Run command.
2. Type**regedit** in the dialog box and hit Enter.
3. Click Yes on the UAC prompt to open Registry Editor.
4. In the Registry Editor window, navigate to the following path:  
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Hvsi
5. Double-click**EnableVirtualGPU** in the right pane.

 After completing the above steps, close the Registry window and restart your computer.
