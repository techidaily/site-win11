## Enhancing Window 11'S Secure Browsing Graphically

 Microsoft Edge's Application Guard is a stellar security feature, providing your device with malware defense while browsing the web. Even though this application offers great protection, the Advanced Graphics feature comes disabled by default.

Microsoft has added an option allowing you to turn on advanced graphics in their Application Guard for Windows 11\. In this guide, we'll show you how to enable advanced graphics in Application Guard for Edge.

## 2\. How to Enable Advanced Graphics via Registry Editor

 If you don't like the idea of tinkering with the Windows Settings page, you can also use the Registry Editor to enable advanced graphics in Application Guard for Edge. But keep in mind that tweaking the Windows Registry is a risky endeavor, so proceed carefully. To be safe,[back up your registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) before making any changes.

1. Press**Win + R** on your keyboard to open the Run command.

3. Click Yes on the UAC prompt to open Registry Editor.
4. In the Registry Editor window, navigate to the following path:  
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Hvsi
5. Double-click**EnableVirtualGPU** in the right pane.
