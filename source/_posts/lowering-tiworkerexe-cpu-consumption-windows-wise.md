## Lowering TiWorker.exe CPU Consumption Windows-Wise

 Did you recently find that your Windows system is running slowly, and your CPU usage has skyrocketed? Chances are the culprit behind these issues is TiWorker.exe - a Windows system process that runs in the background and can take up high amounts of CPU resources if it encounters errors. In this article, we’ll explain what TiWorker.exe is and how to fix errors related to it.

## What Is TiWorker.exe?

 TiWorker.exe is a legitimate system process that executes background tasks on Windows. It is associated with the Windows Update service and installs and manages system updates. This process runs automatically whenever the system is idle, or you can manually trigger it by clicking "check for updates" on Windows.

 TiWorker.exe poses no security threat and is generally safe to run in the background. However, it can cause excessive CPU usage if it encounters errors during its execution, which can slow your computer down and lag. Therefore, you must identify the root cause of TiWorker.exe-related errors and fix them.

 Below, we’ll look at some of the most common fixes for TiWorker.exe's high CPU usage.

## 1\. Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter

 The Windows Update Troubleshooter can detect and fix most problems that cause TiWorker.exe to take up excessive CPU resources. To run the troubleshooter, do the following.

1. Press **Win + I** on your keyboard to open the Settings app.
2. In the Settings menu, select **System** from the left pane.
3. Click **Other troubeshooters** on the next page.

4. Locate **Windows Update** and click the **Run** button.

 This should detect and fix any errors that are causing TiWorker.exe to take up too much CPU usage. Once the process completes, restart your computer and check if TiWorker.exe is still consuming high CPU resources.

## 2\. Run the System Maintenance Troubleshooter

 You can also run the System Maintenance Troubleshooter to fix TiWorker.exe-related errors. It detects and fixes disk fragmentation, registry problems, and other errors that cause TiWorker.exe to take up too much CPU.

 To run the troubleshooter, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on Start and select **Run** from the menu list.
2. In the dialog box, type the following and hit Enter:  
%systemroot%\system32\msdt.exe -id MaintenanceDiagnostic
3. The System Maintenance Troubleshooter will now open.
4. On the Troubleshooter page, click **Advanced**.

5. Check **Apply repairs automatically** and click **Run as administrator**.
6. Click **Next** and follow the instructions to complete the process.

 Once you finish running the troubleshooter, restart your computer and see if it solves the issue.

## 3\. Clear the Software Distribution Folder

 The Software Distribution folder stores temporary files associated with Windows updates. If this folder gets cluttered, TiWorker.exe may consume too many CPU resources. To fix this, you can delete the Software Distribution directory and let Windows create a new one. Here’s how to do this:

1. Press the **Win + R** shortcut key to open the Run window.
2. Type **services.msc** in the dialog box and click **OK**.
3. Find **Windows Update** in the Services list and double-click it.
4. In the Properties window, select Stop under the Service status section.
5. Now press **Win + E** on your keyboard to open File Explorer.

6. Navigate to _C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution_ and delete all files and folders in this directory.  
 You can copy and paste **C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution** in the File Explorer address bar and hit Enter to access the folder directly.
7. Now close File Explorer and go back to the Services window.
8. Scroll down to **Windows Update**, right-click on it and select **Start** to restart the service.

 After you complete these steps, restart your computer and check if TiWorker.exe is still taking up too much CPU usage. If so, continue to the next solution.

## 4\. Perform Several General Fixes

 If none of the above solutions help, you can try performing some general fixes to fix the TiWorker.exe issue. These include [running system file checker](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/) to detect and repair corrupted system files.

 You can also try [performing a clean boot](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/), which disables all third-party applications and services and helps you identify the cause of TiWorker.exe's high CPU usage.
