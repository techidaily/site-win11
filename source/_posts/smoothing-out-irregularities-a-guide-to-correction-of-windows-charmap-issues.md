## Smoothing Out Irregularities: A Guide to Correction of Windows CharMap Issues

 A character map is a Windows utility for inserting special characters, symbols, and glyphs into documents. However, this application may sometimes have broken files or configuration issues that prevent it from working in Windows 11.

 If you are experiencing this issue, don't worry. Here's a guide that will help you fix Character Map problems on Windows.

## 1\. Check for Windows Updates and Restart Your Computer

 If you are having trouble opening the Character Map on Windows, check if your computer is up-to-date. Windows often downloads and installs updates to fix bugs, so if your Windows version is outdated, Character Map may not function properly.

In order to check for available Windows updates, follow these steps:

1. Press**Win + I** on your keyboard to open System Settings.
2. Select**Windows Update** from the left pane.
3. Now on the right side, click**Check for updates** .
4. If any updates are available, the system will automatically download and install them.

 If you already have the latest version of your computer, try restarting your computer. It can often resolve small issues and is a great way to troubleshoot any problems you may experience with software or applications.

## 2\. Run the SFC and DISM Scan Tools

 Another way to fix this issue is to run the System File Checker (SFC) tool. This is a built-in Windows utility that scans your files and repairs any corrupted or missing ones. It also checks for incompatible software programs and hardware drivers that may be causing issues with your system.

To run the system file checker tool, follow these steps:

1. Run Command Prompt window in administrator mode (see [how to run Command Prompt as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/) for more info).
2. Type**sfc /scannow** into the command line and press**Enter** to start the scan process.

 The scan will take several minutes to complete, and your computer may restart several times along the way.

 After the SFC scan is complete, run Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM). This command will repair corrupted system images and restore system files. The steps are as follows:

1. Start Command Prompt with administrative privileges, as above.
2. In the command prompt, type the following command:  
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealthDISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth

 The process may take a while to complete. After executing the DISM command, restart your computer to check if it has resolved the issue.

## 3\. Uninstall the Latest Windows Update

 If you've recently updated your Windows to the latest Windows version and are experiencing trouble accessing the Character Map, uninstall it. The process of uninstalling a Windows update is straightforward and simple. Here's how you do it:

1. Open up your Control Panel (see [how to open the Control Panel on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-control-panel/) ).
2. Navigate to**Programs and Features** .
3. From there, select**View installed updates** in the left sidebar.
