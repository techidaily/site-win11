2. Click the**Settings** tab in the bottom left corner.
3. Select**Notifications** from the left sidebar.

## 4\. Turn Off Battery Saver Mode

 When you enable battery saver mode, Windows pauses background app activities on your computer. While this is a great way to[improve battery life on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-improve-battery-life/) , it may prevent apps like Intel Unison from working efficiently.

 To avoid any performance issues, it's best to turn off battery saver mode on Windows. Here’s how you can go about it:

1. Press**Win + I** to open the Settings app.
2. In the**System** tab, click on**Power & battery** .
3. Under Battery, click on**Battery saver** and click the**Turn off now** button.

## 5\. Disable Any Active Third-Party Antivirus Programs

 At times, third-party antivirus programs on your PC can get too cautious and prevent apps from exchanging files and syncing data. To check for this possibility, you need to temporarily disable your antivirus program.

 You can typically do this by right-clicking the antivirus program’s icon in the system tray and selecting**Disable until next restart** . However, the instructions will differ between antivirus programs, so if you're stuck, check your antivirus' official help documentation for instructions.

 Once disabled, try using the Intel Unison app again. If this solves your problem, you can go through your antivirus program’s settings and whitelist the Intel Unison app.

## 6\. Disconnect and Reconnect Your Phone

 Connection issues between the Intel Unison app and your phone can also cause the app to stop working on Windows. In most cases, you should be able to resolve such issues by disconnecting and reconnecting your phone.

 This should re-establish the connection between Windows and your phone, resolving any issues caused by misconfigured settings.

 To disconnect your phone from the Intel Unison app, follow these steps:

1. Open the Intel Unison app on your PC.
2. Click the**computer icon** in the top left corner and select**Manage my devices** .
3. Click the**Forget this device** option.
4. Next, open the Intel Unison app on your Android or iPhone and scan the QR code on your PC.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to pair your phone.

## 7\. Repair or Reset the Intel Unison App

 Both Windows 10 and 11 include a useful repair tool for fixing app-related issues. Check out our guide on[how to repair apps on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-repair-apps-programs/) to fix the Intel Unison app without affecting your data.

 Wait for the repair process to complete and then try using the app again. If the problem persists, try resetting the app from the same menu. Doing so should delete all the app data and reset the app to its default state.

## 8\. Reinstall the Intel Unison App

 Finally, if none of the above solutions work, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling the app. If you need help with that, check our guide on[how to uninstall apps on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-uninstall-apps-on-windows/) and follow the instructions outlined there.

 Once removed, head over to the[Intel Unison page on the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/intel%C2%AE-unison%E2%84%A2/9PP9GZM2GN26) to download the Intel Unison app. Hopefully, this should help resolve the issue.
