## How to Use Separate Wallpapers on Different Monitors in Windows 11

 Windows 11 offers a handful of pre-installed wallpapers to set as your desktop background. If you prefer a custom background, you can use a saved picture or [download high-resolution wallpapers from the internet](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-sites-to-download-very-high-resolution-wallpapers/) and set different wallpaper for each monitor.

 To customize which wallpapers appear on which monitor:

1. Press **Win + I** to open **Settings**.
2. Open the **Personalization** tab, then click **Background** in the right pane.
3. Make sure the **Personalize your background** dropdown is set to **Picture**.

4. Click **Browse photos** and choose the image you want to set as a desktop background. Repeat the steps to add more photos.
5. Now right-click the image you want to set as a background for your primary monitor and choose **Set for** **desktop > Desktop 1**. Similarly, right-click on another wallpaper and select **Set for desktop > Desktop 2**. Repeat the steps for all your monitors.

 Alternatively, you can configure and [set a wallpaper slideshow in Windows 11 to automatically set different wallpapers](http://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-slideshows-no-installs/) on different monitors. To do this, select the **Personalize your background** dropdown and choose **Slideshow**. Then, click **Browse** and select the image album folder where your desktop background images are saved.

 Once done, Windows will regularly cycle through the pictures from the folder as a slideshow, at the **Change picture every** interval you choose.

## How to Set a Different Desktop Background for Each Monitor in Windows 10

 Like Windows 11, you can set different desktop backgrounds for different monitors in Windows 10:

1. Press **Win + I** to open **Settings**.
2. Open **Personalization**, then click the **Background** tab.
3. Click the **Background** drop-down and choose **Picture**.
4. Click **Browse** and choose the picture you want to set as your desktop background.
5. Right-click on the picture you want to apply to your primary display and select **Set for monitor 1**. Similarly, right-click on another image and choose **Set for monitor 2**. Repeat the steps if you have more than two monitors

 Now, each monitor in your setup should have a different wallpaper. If you prefer, choose the **Slideshow** background option to let Windows set a new desktop background from your specified image album at regular intervals.

## How to Set Different Desktop Backgrounds on Different Monitors Using Control Panel

 You can use the classic Control Panel's **Personalization and Appearance** menu to set a desktop background for your monitors. This is also handy for [setting the wallpaper on an unactivated Windows computer](http://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-change-wallpaper-without-activation/).

1. Press **Win + R** to open **Run**.
2. Copy and paste the following command and click **OK**.  
`shell:::{ED834ED6-4B5A-4bfe-8F11-A626DCB6A921} -Microsoft.Personalization\pageWallpaper`
3. In the Control Panel, click the **Picture location** drop-down and choose **Windows Desktop Backgrounds**.
4. You can use the existing images or click **Browse** to import custom desktop background images.
5. Right-click on an image and choose **Set for monitor 1** or **Set for monitor 2** to apply the desktop background to either of your displays.

6. To create a slideshow, drag your cursor to highlight all the images you want to use, right-click on any pictures, and choose **Set as a slideshow**.

 That's how you use different wallpapers for each monitor in Windows 10 and 11\. To keep your background from getting stale, consider turning on the slideshow feature to let Windows automatically set new desktop wallpapers from your curated image album every hour, day, or few minutes.
