## How to Save and Restore Desktop Icon Layouts With DesktopOK

 DesktopOK is an old app for saving and restoring Windows desktop icon layouts that’s still actively supported. You can utilize this software on the Windows 11/10/8/7 platforms. Aside from enabling you to manually save desktop layouts, it includes options for automatically saving desktop layouts. This is how you can save and restore a desktop icon layout with DesktopOK:

1. Open this [download page for DesktopOK](http://www.softwareok.com/?Download=DesktopOK) within a web browser.
2. Click the **DesktopOK\_Installer\_x64.zip** download link. That’s the download link for 64-bit Windows 11/10, but users with older 32-bit platforms should click DesktopOK\_Installer.zip.
3. [Go into Windows File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) (click the library folder taskbar icon) and browse to the directory to which DesktopOK downloaded.
4. [Unzip the ZIP archive](https://www.makeuseof.com/unzip-files-windows-10/) to extract DesktopOK to a subfolder.
5. Open DesktopOK’s extracted subfolder and double-click the **DesktopOK\_Installer\_x64**.

1. Select **English** on the Language drop-down menu.
2. Press **Install** to install DesktopOK at the default folder location.

 If you want to select saved icon layouts from the right-click menu, you’ll need to enable context menu integration. To do that, click **Options** and select **Add Context Menu** \> **Add to the desktop** **context menu**.
