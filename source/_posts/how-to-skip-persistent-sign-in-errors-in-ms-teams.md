## How to Skip Persistent Sign-In Errors in MS Teams

## 1\. Update Microsoft Teams

 Microsoft constantly releases new app updates to add more features and fix any bugs. If you’re running an old Teams version, you should install any available updates to stop it from asking you to sign in.

 Launch the Microsoft Teams app and open the **three-dot** menu next to your profile icon. Then, head to **Settings** and click **About Teams**. Microsoft Teams will check for any available updates and install them if available.

 Alternatively, you can [update Windows apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-apps-windows-11/) through Microsoft Store.

## 2\. Use Microsoft Teams Online

 If updating the app didn’t stop Microsoft Teams from asking you to sign in, there’s an easy alternative for you. Use Microsoft Teams online.

 Go to the [Microsoft Teams website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software), and sign in using your credentials. This way, you’re not missing anything while you figure out how to fix the desktop app. You can even [join a Microsoft Teams meeting on your smartphone](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yvhUaGLFmNOyWhJyAvgfqhhiYAXMablw%5Fpcyf8%5F3MD4/edit).

## 3\. Clear the Microsoft Teams Cache

 Microsoft Teams stores cache to load faster and improve the overall user experience. While this may sound good, if the app collected too much cache or the cache somehow got corrupted, Teams will stop working properly.

 This might include [Microsoft Teams crashing](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-teams-keeps-crashing-windows/), taking a lot of your system resources, or repeatedly asking you to sign in. To fix it, you should delete the Microsoft Teams cache.

1. Press **Win + R** to bring up a Run dialog.
2. Type **%appdata%** and click **Ok**.
3. In the File Explorer window, head to **Microsoft > Teams**.
4. Select all folders and permanently delete them.

![Clear Microsoft Teams Cache in Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/clear-microsoft-teams-cache-in-windows.jpg)

 Restart Microsoft Teams and check if the issue is now solved. You may notice a decline in the app’s performance, but there’s no reason to worry. The app is now rebuilding its cache which shouldn’t take too long.

## 4\. Remove the App’s Credentials

 Windows Credential Manager is designed to make your life easier, as it stores your credentials for faster access. But if something's wrong with how it managers Teams credentials, you might run into the sign-in issue. In this case, you should remove the app's credentials.

1. Press **Windows key + R** to bring up a Run dialog.
2. Type **control /name Microsoft.CredentialManager** and press **Enter**.
3. In the Credential Manager window, select **Windows Credentials**.
4. From **Generic Credentials,** click the Microsoft Teams credentials.
5. Select **Remove**.

## 5\. Try Some Generic Fixes for Windows Apps

 There are some generic fixes for all Windows apps that may also fix Microsoft Teams when it pesters you to sign in. These include:

### Restart the App

 Microsoft Teams could ask you to sign in due to a temporary app glitch. In this case, the first thing you should try is to restart the app. However, simply closing Microsoft Teams is not enough as the Teams’ background processes will still run.

 To fully restart the app, launch Task Manager by pressing **Ctrl + Shift + Esc**. Then, right-click **Microsoft Teams** and select **End Task**.
