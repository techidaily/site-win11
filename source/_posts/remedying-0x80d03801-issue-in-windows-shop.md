## 2\. Clear Microsoft Store Cache

 It’s been done to death, and there’s a solid reason why. The cache is where your app or browser stores past search history to help you load things faster next time (And yes, there's a [big difference between cache and cookies](https://www.makeuseof.com/difference-cache-and-cookies/)). However, in some cases, this cache can get corrupted or broken, leading to unexpected errors.

 If your cache has been corrupted, it’s probably causing the error code 0x80d03801 for you right now. So [clearing the cache](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-clear-caches/) of your Microsoft Store app is well worth the try in such cases. Here’s how you can do that:

1. Head to the **Start menu** search bar and type ‘wsreset’.
2. Right-click on the best match and launch it as the administrator.
