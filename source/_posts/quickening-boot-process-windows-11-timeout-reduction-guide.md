## 4\. Change Boot Menu Timeout Using the Boot Options

 Another efficient way to configure the boot menu timeout is through the Boot Manager.

 To modify the boot menu timeout through the Boot Manager, follow these instructions:

1. Open the Start Menu, click the **Power icon** and choose **Restart** from the context menu. If this method doesn't work, try any other [ways to restart your Windows PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/).
