## Windows 11 Unlocked: Effective TPM Deactivation

 The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a security chip that safeguards your computer against malware and other attacks. It plays a crucial role in the installation of Windows 11 and is also an integral part of several security features like Windows Hello and BitLocker.

 If you need to clear the TPM for any reason, you've come to the right place. This guide features four ways to clear TPM on Windows 11\.

* The TPM stores crucial information about drivers and applications installed on your computer. Therefore, you must reset the TPM before selling your computer to protect your privacy.
* Clearing the TPM can also help you troubleshoot problems related to security, encryption, and authentication.
* You should clear the TPM before clean installing a new operating system. This way, the OS can fully deploy its TPM-based functionalities like attestation.
