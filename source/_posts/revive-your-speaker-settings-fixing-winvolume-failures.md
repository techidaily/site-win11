## 3\. Try Some Generic Windows Fixes

 If none of those did the job, there are some simple fixes you can do around Windows.

* There’s a chance that outdated or corrupt audio drivers are the reason why you can change your Volume Mixer settings. Fortunately, there are [multiple ways to update your audio drivers](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-audio-drivers-windows/) .
* If you’ve installed [sound-controlling apps to amplify your listening experience](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-sound-amplfication-apps/) , they might take control of your audio settings. You can try closing or uninstalling third-party apps to have Volume Mixer control the audio output.
* Additionally, you could [perform a clean boot](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/) to check if there’s an installed app that manages your computer’s audio without you knowing about it.
