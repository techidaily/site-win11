## Window Navigation Optimization: Adding 'This PC' Icons

 "This PC" on Windows is a handy folder that lets you quickly access all the drives. From it, you can manage your entire system. However, it isn't readily available on the desktop most of the time. This is why accessing it through File Explorer can feel tiresome, especially if you need to access it ten times a day.

 If accessing the "This PC" folder from File Explorer feels cumbersome, here's how you can move it directly to your desktop.

 Similar to how we have added the "This PC" icon, you can[add other icons to your desktop in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-add-icon-to-desktop-windows/) , such as Recycle Bin, Network, and Control Panel.

 Don't restore the icon settings after making this change. This will reverse our recent change, and the "This PC" icon will again disappear.
