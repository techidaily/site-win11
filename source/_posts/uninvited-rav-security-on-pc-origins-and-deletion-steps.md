## Uninvited Rav Security on PC - Origins and Deletion Steps

 If you have RAV Antivirus running on your computer but don't remember installing it, it may have been installed along with another application. It sometimes gets bundled in with other apps, and you are more likely to experience this if you download a torrenting app.

 While RAV antivirus isn't bad by any means, sometimes you will accidentally install it without wanting it. Thus, if it's now on your computer and now you want to uninstall it, here's how.
