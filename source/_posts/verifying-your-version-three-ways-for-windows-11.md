## Verifying Your Version: Three Ways for Windows 11

 Although Microsoft allows you to use Windows 11 without activation, using a non-activated copy may not be the best idea as it restricts your access to certain key features and critical security updates. If you’re unsure, there are several ways to know if your copy of Windows 11 is activated.

 You can check your Windows 11 PC’s activation status via the Settings app, the Run command, or a command-line tool. This post will walk you through all three methods in detail.

## 1\. How to Check Windows 11's Activation State Using the Settings App

 The Settings app in Windows contains all the necessary information about the Windows edition, its activation status, and the product key.

 To check Windows 11 activation status using the Settings app, follow these steps:

1. Press**Win + I** to launch the Settings app.
2. In the**System** tab, click on**Activation** .
3. Check the status next to**Activation state** .

 If the status reads**Active** , it means your Windows 11 copy is activated. On the other hand, if the status displays**Not active** , it implies that the copy of your Windows 11 is not yet activated.

 You can click the**Activation state** option to reveal more details. Depending on the activation status, you should see one of the following messages:

* Windows is activated.
* Windows is activated with a digital license.
* Windows is activated with a digital license linked to your Microsoft account.
* Windows is not activated.
