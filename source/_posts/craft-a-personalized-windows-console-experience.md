## Craft a Personalized Windows Console Experience

 If you find the default terminal emulator on your Windows PC—Windows Console Host—to be too basic and lacking in features, there are a few good alternatives. These alternative apps, like Windows Terminal, offer several advanced features like tabs, profiles, the ability to open multiple windows, and more.

 Setting a terminal as the default app for Command Prompt and PowerShell is fairly straightforward. Here are some methods you can use to make the switch.

## 1\. How to Change the Default Terminal App via Windows Terminal's Settings

 The most straightforward way to change the default command-line interface on your Windows computer is by using Windows Terminal's settings menu. Here are the steps you can follow.

1. Press **Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type **Terminal** in the search box and press **Enter** (see [how to open the Windows Terminal](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-windows-terminal/) for more methods).
3. Click the **down-arrow icon** at the top and select **Settings** from the resulting menu.
4. Use the drop-down menu next to **Default terminal application** to select your chosen terminal from the list.
5. Optionally, you can set the **Default profile** that opens when you launch the Terminal app.
6. Click the **Save** button at the bottom.

 If you want to undo the above changes later, simply repeat the above steps and select **Windows console host** or **Let Windows decide** in the **Default terminal application** drop-down menu.

 Alternatively, you can also reset the Terminal app on your PC. If you are interested in doing that, check our guide on [how to reset the Windows Terminal settings to their defaults in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-reset-terminal-settings/).

## 2\. How to Change the Default Terminal App Using Windows Console Host Properties

 Another way to change the default terminal app on your Windows 10 or 11 PC is via the Windows Console Host properties. Here are the steps for the same.

1. Click the **magnifying icon** on the taskbar to access the search menu.
2. Type in **command prompt** or **powershell** in the search box and select the first result that appears.
3. Right-click on the title bar of the Command Prompt or PowerShell window and select **Properties**.
4. In the **“Command Prompt” Properties** or **“Windows PowerShell” Properties** window that appears, switch to the **Terminal** tab.
5. Click the drop-down menu under **Default Terminal Application** to select your favorite terminal app, or **Let Windows decide** to revert the option to its default.
6. Click the **OK** button to save your changes.

## 3\. How to Change the Default Terminal App From Windows Settings

 The Settings app makes it easy to set or [change the default apps on your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/change-windows-11-default-apps/). Here’s how you can use it to set your chosen terminal as the default app for Command Prompt and PowerShell.

2. Select the **Privacy & security** tab from the left pane.
3. Under the **Security** section, click the **For developers** option.
4. Use the drop-down menu next to **Terminal** to select your chosen terminal app, or choose **Let Windows decide** to undo any changes you've made previously.
