## 1\. How to Disable or Enable Registry Editor Access via the Group Policy Editor

 The most straightforward way to block access to the Registry Editor on Windows is via the Group Policy Editor.

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type **gpedit.msc** in the box and press **Enter**.
3. In the Local Group Policy Editor window, use the left pane to navigate to **User Configuration > Administrative Templates > System**.
4. Double-click the **Prevent access to registry editing tools** policy in the right pane.
5. Select the **Enabled** option.
6. Click **Apply** followed by **OK**.

 Once you complete the above steps, the Registry Editor will be disabled on your PC.

 Although you cannot access the Registry Editor to reverse the above changes, it's still possible to re-enable Registry Editor access. For that, you will have to [create and run a REG file](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-registry-file-guide/). Here’s how you can go about it.

1. Press **Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type **notepad** in the search box and press **Enter**.
3. In the notepad window, paste the following command.  
`Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System] "DisableRegistryTools"=dword:00000000`
