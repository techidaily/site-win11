## Troubleshooting Non-Responsive Tablet Navigation in Windows

 Can't use multi-finger gestures on your touchpad? Is it not responding when you zoom in, scroll down, or switch between applications? Now's the time to fix it. This guide shows you fast tips for getting your touchpad gestures back to normal on Windows.

## Why Are Touchpad Gestures Not Working?

 Touchpad gestures may fail to work on Windows due to several reasons. Some of them are:

1. **Outdated or Corrupt Drivers:** Touchpad gestures rely on the touchpad's driver for proper functioning. If the driver is outdated or incompatible with your Windows version, gestures may not work.
2. **Disabled touchpad gestures:** Windows allows users to customize touchpad settings, including gestures. The gestures may have been disabled intentionally or accidentally.
3. **Hardware-related problems:** Conflicts with hardware devices on your system interfere with touchpad gestures. This happens when the touchpad is incompatible with your hardware or technical malfunctions occur.
4. **Third-party software interference:** Third-party applications sometimes interfere with Windows touchpad gestures. If you’ve recently installed any software or apps on your computer, uninstall them.
5. **Incorrect touchpad settings:** It's possible that the touchpad settings are incorrect or misconfigured, resulting in gesture recognition failure. In this case, resetting the touchpad settings to default may work.

 Now that you know the common causes of touchpad gestures not working on Windows. If you encounter this issue, try these solutions.

## 1\. Restart Your PC

 It may sound obvious, but restarting your computer fixes minor glitches and bugs. This refreshes memory and flushes out misbehaving processes. So before you delve into more complex solutions, restart your computer and check if it helps.

 For this, press **Win + X** on your keyboard. Then press **U** and select **Restart**. This closes all open programs and restarts your device. Once it starts up, check if your touchpad gestures work again.

## 2\. Enable Touchpad Gestures

 If your touchpad gestures are disabled, you can't execute multi-finger commands. To enable gestures, access your touchpad settings and adjust accordingly. Here's how to do it.

1. Press **Win + I** on your keyboard to open the Settings menu.
2. Once it opens, click **Bluetooth & devices** in the left sidebar.
3. Scroll down in the right pane and click on the **Touchpad** section.

 Once you configure the settings, your touchpad is ready for three-finger and four-finger commands. Now close the Settings window and test the gestures.

 Outdated or corrupt touchpad drivers also affect gesture recognition. So, if you’re still having issues, try updating your touchpad drivers.

1. Press **Win + R** on your keyboard to open the Run command.
2. Type **devmgmt.msc** in the Run search box and press Enter. This opens the Device Manager window.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
5. On the next page, choose **Search automatically for drivers**.

 This allows Windows to find and install the latest available drivers for your touchpad. If this doesn't work, search for the touchpad manufacturer's drivers online and install them that way.

## 4\. Reinstall Touchpad Drivers

 If updating the drivers didn’t help, try reinstalling them. This removes the current touchpad drivers from your system and installs them again from scratch.

 To reinstall the touchpad driver, follow these steps.

1. Right-click on **Start** and select **Device Manager** from the menu list.
2. Double-click on **Mice and other pointing devices** to expand it.
3. Right-click on the touchpad device and select **Uninstall device**.  
![Uninstall Mice and other pointing devices](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/uninstall-mice-and-other-pointing-devices.jpg)
4. Click **Uninstall** when prompted.

 Now wait for the process to finish. Once it does, restart your computer. Windows will automatically reinstall new touchpad drivers for your device at startup.

## 5\. Run Hardware and Devices troubleshooter

 Sometimes technical glitches make touchpad gestures unresponsive. In that case, run the hardware and devices troubleshooter to diagnose and resolve the issue.

 To run hardware and devices troubleshooter, follow these steps:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run command.
2. Type **msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic** in the search box and hit Enter. This opens the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter window.
3. Click on **Advanced** and check the box for **Apply repairs automatically**.

## 6\. Check for Third-Party Software Interference

 Sometimes third-party applications can interfere with Windows touchpad gestures. So, if you’ve recently installed any new software or apps on your computer, try uninstalling them and see if it solves the problem.

 To remove the applications, open Control Panel and click on **Uninstall a program**. Here you can uninstall any application that you don’t need. After removing the application, restart your computer and test the touchpad.

 If this doesn’t help, go to the **Programs and Features** tab in Control Panel and use the **Turn Windows features on or off** option to disable any unnecessary programs.

![Turn Windows features on or off](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/turn-windows-features-on-or-off.jpg)

 This stops these programs from interfering with Windows processes. Once you’ve made the changes, restart your computer and check if the touchpad gestures are working again.
