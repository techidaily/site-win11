## Embracing Deity Interactions with Your Windows 11 PC

 Since Windows 8 over a decade ago, Microsoft has pushed for the Settings app to replace the ever-reliable Control Panel. Windows 11, in addition to its sleek UI upgrade, also brought us the best version of the Settings app in terms of usability and function.

 Despite the (painfully slow) evolution of the Settings app, many users believe it still can’t compare to the ease and usability of the old-school Windows Control Panel. If you’re tired of looking for needles in the haystack that is the Settings app, you need to learn all about God Mode on Windows 11.

## What Is the Secret God Mode Feature on Windows 11?

 If you’ve ever had to dive into the depths of the Settings app or the Control Panel to change a particular Windows setting, you’ll be able to relate to the frustration. Fortunately, you can enable the secret "God Mode" feature and get to all basic settings with a single click, think of it as a folder with a list of important Windows configuration options.

 God Mode gives you easy access to almost every advanced setting of your Windows PC, so you never have to dive into the unfriendly Settings app or the Control Panel again. You can even[customize God Mode on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-god-mode-customization/) to suit your workflow.

## How to Turn On God Mode in Windows 11

 Contrary to what its name suggests, turning on God Mode on Windows 11 is quite simple. Here’s what you need to do to access primary and advanced system settings with just a click:

1. Right-click on your Desktop, hover over**New** and then select**Folder** to create a new folder on your Desktop.

2. Rename the newly created folder to  
`GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}`
3. Click anywhere on your Desktop to save the changes. You’ll notice that the folder name will disappear, and the folder icon may change to the Control Panel icon.
4. Open the folder to view the list of possible setting configurations. You can quickly double-click any setting to launch the option or drag and move that shortcut onto the Desktop or any other folder.
