## 5 Clear Signals It's Time for Windows Reset

 Encountering a bug or two while running your Windows is no big deal, but if you’re facing problems on your Windows recurrently, then something is probably wrong with your operating system.

 In cases like this, it’s best to perform a factory reset and start everything fresh. But it’s also important not to get into factory reset for every little thing. So if you’re thinking of doing a factory reset, it’s vital that you’re sure that you actually need to perform one.

## 1\. You're Experiencing Recurring Software Bugs

 As we said above, facing a software glitch occasionally is not a big deal. Part of using an operating system software of any kind, whether it’s Windows, Apple, Android, etc., is getting to terms with the fact that you might sometimes face errors or bugs that might take some time to resolve.

 However, if it’s become a recurrent problem, then it’s totally possible that your PC has become cluttered with years of old software programs, which are now making it difficult to run your system.

 In cases like this, we believe a factory reset is your best option, and it will bring your system back to a state where everything was working fine.

## 2\. You Have Privacy Concerns

 If you’re planning to get a new PC or laptop, it’s very likely that you will get rid of your computer. Whether you’re planning to do that by selling it at some store, exchanging it for your new computer, or even donating it to someone, it’s important that you first [perform a factory reset on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-ways-factory-reset-windows-computer/).

 “By why?” you might wonder.

 It’s simple: for privacy. A factory reset will clean the computer of your personal and sensitive information, which can otherwise become troublesome for you. It can be anything, your photos, passwords, or confidential work—a factory reset will help you remove everything in a single go.

## 3\. There's Corruption Within Important Windows System Files

 While the Windows errors of the milk and water variety can be fixed by an array of simpler means and rarely need you to pull the plug of a full-blown factory reset, damage or corruption of your Windows System files is a completely different deal.

 Windows System Files, in short, are the base of your Windows operating system. Through a combination of processes, they make sure that you can run other applications on your PC smoothly and make use of your system in any meaningful way.

 For example, the Windows Registry files contain a database of your settings and configuration of your Windows software and hardware. It’s very difficult to [fix the files on your Registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-registry-errors-not-bother/) once things get awry with them unless you’ve already backed them up.

 So factory reset will be a worthy option to try out in cases like this. Similarly, System Libraries, System Configuration Libraries (.sys), Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs), etc. are another set of System files that should receive a similar treatment.

## 4\. You Notice an Overall Dip in Performance

![a chart showing decline](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/a-chart-showing-decline.jpg)

 It’s normal to face a performance dip in your computer’s performance after a while. Wear and tear caused by years of usage, fragmented drives, and conflicts among various installed software are some possible causes for this decline. But this decline is a long, arduous process that generally takes—or at least ideally should—years to happen.

 However, if you’ve started encountering these problems just after a few years of usage, something else might be happening under the tin.

 Changes made to system settings or similar configurations, resource conflicts between hardware and software, compatibility issues among software, and clutter caused by installed software, are some reasons you might be facing this performance dip.

 By factory resetting your PC, you can fix this overall performance drop in your PC.

## All the Signs You Should Have Done a Factory Reset Yesterday

 A factory reset isn’t a panacea for all your Windows problems. In fact, much simpler solutions exist, like System Restore or troubleshooting tools, that can fix your technical woes quickly. However, if you have encountered any of the above issues—and other more straightforward solutions have failed to deliver—then a factory reset is precisely what might save the day.

 In cases like this, it’s best to perform a factory reset and start everything fresh. But it’s also important not to get into factory reset for every little thing. So if you’re thinking of doing a factory reset, it’s vital that you’re sure that you actually need to perform one.
