### 1\. Reboot Your System

 The first step in resolving this error is to[restart the Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/) and see if the problem resolves itself. This will help to refresh the system and clear any temporary files that may be causing the issue.

### 2\. Update Drivers
