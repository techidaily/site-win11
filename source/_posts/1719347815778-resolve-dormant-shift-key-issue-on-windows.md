## Resolve Dormant Shift Key Issue on Windows

 The Shift key is a modifier key on a computer keyboard. It capitalizes letters, accesses special characters and symbols, and simultaneously deletes multiple texts.

 If the Shift key stops working, it could disrupt your workflow. This guide explains how to troubleshoot and repair the Shift key not functioning on your computer.

## 1\. Check for Physical Damage

 If your shift key suddenly stops working, it could be a sign of physical damage. To check for physical damage, turn off your computer and carefully inspect the key for dirt or debris. You can also turn your laptop upside down and shake it gently. If you find any, use a soft brush or compressed air to gently clean the area.

 If you need help, see our guide on [how to clean your keyboard and sterilize viruses and bacteria](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-clean-keyboard/).

## 2\. Restart Your Computer

 If you've confirmed there are no physical connection issues, [restart your computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/). This gives the machine a fresh start and could potentially resolve minor software glitches that might cause the shift key to not work. Remember to save files or applications before shutting down to protect your work.

 This will ensure that none of your work is lost because of the restart. After restarting, open a text document and try typing again. If the shift key remains unresponsive, there may be an issue with your software settings.

## 3\. Check Your Keyboard Settings

 The Filter key is an accessibility feature on Windows that could interfere with your keyboard's normal functioning.

 Here's how to do it:

1. Press **Win + I** on your keyboard to open the Settings menu.
2. From the left sidebar, click on the **Accessibility** tab.
3. Scroll down to the **Interaction** section and click the **Keyboard** option.
4. From here, locate the **Filter keys** option and toggle it off.

 Once done, close the Settings window and see if the shift key is now working.

1. Press **Win + R** on your keyboard to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type **devmgmt.msc** in the text field and hit **Enter**.

 To reinstall the keyboard drivers, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on Start and select **Device Manager** from the list.
2. Double-click on **Keyboards** and select **Uninstall device**.

 Now close the Device Manager window and restart your computer. Windows will now automatically install drivers on startup. After that, test the shift key again and see if the problem is solved.

## 5\. Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter

 Hardware and devices troubleshooter is a Windows program that scans your computer for hardware-related issues. Running this troubleshooter diagnoses and resolves underlying problems that may cause the shift key not to work.

## 8\. Try a Different Keyboard

 If the suggested solutions do not solve the problem, chances are that the issue lies with your keyboard hardware. To isolate this from other causes, try a different keyboard and check if the shift key works now.

 If you don't have another keyboard, open a virtual one. This is an on-screen keyboard that lets you type without physical keys. To access it, press **Win + R** on your keyboard. This will open the Run command dialog box.

![On-screen Keyboard](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/on-screen-keyboard.jpg)

 Type **osk** in the text field and hit **Enter**. Now test the shift key on this virtual keyboard. If it works now, you should consider replacing the physical keyboard.
