File Locksmith was only added to the app in an update in late 2022\. If you don't see it in your current version of PowerToys, click the**General** tab and select**Check for Updates** .

## When Is File Locksmith Most Useful?

 Although it might not seem so at first glance, File Locksmith is a very useful utility. Firstly, it can help you better understand which files are being used at any particular moment. It can also tell you why a file you are unsuccessfully trying to delete is being blocked.

 It can also be used to troubleshoot the apps and files that slow down your PC and find performance bottlenecks. When you use it alongside other[ways to troubleshoot and improve PC performance](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-10-faster-performance/) , it can help speed up your PC by quite a bit.

## How to Check Files and Processes in File Locksmith

 You can either check a single file or scan every file in a folder. If a folder has subdirectories, these will also be examined.

 File Locksmith should be enabled by default after being added to PowerToys during the update. If not, you can enable it by opening the PowerToys app, selecting the File Locksmith tab, and clicking the On button.

1. Open File Explorer and find the file or folder you want to check.
2. Right-click on the file/folder, and select**Show more options > What's using this file?**
