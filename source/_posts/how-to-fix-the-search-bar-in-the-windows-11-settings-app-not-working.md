 A restart can fix many issues that are plaguing your system. When you restart your PC, you are essentially instructing it to start with a clean slate, leaving behind issues that might be causing trouble. Restarting your PC can also fix the Search issue in the Settings app.

 However, if your PC frequently requires a restart to fix this issue, the underlying problem affecting the Search feature in the Settings app persists. In that case, you should look for a more robust solution.

## 2\. Install All the Latest Windows Updates

 You can troubleshoot whatever is causing the Search issue in the Settings app by resetting or repairing it. A reset will take the Settings app to a normal state, though the app data will be deleted.

1. Click the Start icon and type "Settings."
2. Right-click on**Settings** , and then click**App settings** .

3. Scroll the page down until you see the**Reset** option.

 Under the**Reset** option, you will see**Repair** and**Reset** . Try repairing the app first, as it will not delete anything. However, if repairing does not work, you should try the**Reset** option.

## 5\. Use Commands in PowerShell to Reset Settings App

![PowerShell Command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/powershell-command.jpg)
