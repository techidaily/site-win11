## Comprehensive Guide to Solving Windows Steam's E84 Glitches

 The error **"Something went wrong while attempting to sign in,"** displayed as "error code e84," occurs when Steam fails to log in users automatically. This error has been around since Steam's October 2022 update.

 If you are experiencing this error, fret not. Here are some solutions you can employ to resolve the error and sign in successfully.

## 1\. Perform Some Preliminary Checks

 First, you should perform these basic fixes, as they may resolve the problem immediately:

* Restart the Steam client and your device.
* [Delete temporary files from your Windows device](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-delete-temporary-files/) , as it often fixes sign-in issues in third-party apps and clients.
* According to some users who have faced this error, using your first username (the one you chose when setting up your account, not the one you currently use) to sign in fixes this issue. Hence, try to log in using that username.
* If you have a VPN enabled on your device, disable it temporarily. If you're outside the United States and aren't currently using a VPN, install one and connect to a US server.
* Interference from other gaming clients can also cause annoying sign-in issues. If you are currently running any other gaming client, especially Riot Client, shut it down.
* Check that your system clock is displaying the correct time. If it's not, check out[how to change the date and time on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-change-date-time/) for more information.

 If the issue persists after applying the above checks and fixes, start applying the remaining fixes.

## 2\. Log Out of Your Steam Account on Other Devices

 Even though using the same Steam account on multiple devices is not forbidden, doing so often leads to sign-in errors like e84\. If your Steam account is currently logged in on other devices, log out of your Steam account from all of them. After that, open the Steam client again and see if you can sign in successfully this time.

 If you don't encounter any errors this time, this confirms that using your account on multiple devices simultaneously caused the error. In the future, always log out of your Steam account before using it on another device. However, if logging out of your account from all other devices makes no difference, move on to the next solution.

## 3\. Reset Your Account Password

 Some users in a[Steam community thread](https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/1/3392923906944531423/) have mentioned that they have successfully fixed this error by simply resetting their password. Therefore, you should also reset your account password. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Go to the[Steam website](https://store.steampowered.com/) .
2. Click on**login** in the top-right corner.  
![Click on the Login Button on Steam Website](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/1-click-on-the-login-button-on-steam-website.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Enter your username, and without entering your password (even if you remember it), click on**Help, I can't sign in** .  
![Click on Help I Canâ€™t Sign In Option From the Login Page on Steam Website](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2-click-on-help-i-can-t-sign-in-option-from-the-login-page-on-steam-website.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. Then, click on**I forgot my Steam Account name or password** .
5. Enter the email address or phone number linked to your account, verify Captcha, and click on**Search** .  
![Click on Search Button on the Steam Support Page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3-click-on-search-button-on-the-steam-support-pag.jpg)
6. By selecting the appropriate option, receive a verification code to your email address or phone number.
7. Verify your identity by clicking the link you receive via email or adding the code you receive by phone.
8. Click on**Reset my password** after that.  
![Click on Reset My Password Option on Steam Website](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/4-click-on-reset-my-password-option-on-steam-website.jpg)
9. Then, follow the on-screen instructions to reset your password.

 After changing your password, restart your device once and try to sign in again with the new password. Hopefully, this time you won't encounter any errors. If resetting the account password does not resolve the issue, proceed to the next step.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4\. Add or Remove Launch Parameters

 Adding the**"-noreactlogin"** parameter in Steam's executable file can also resolve this issue. In technical terms, adding this flag disables the ReactJS-based login window and restores the old one. Follow these steps to add this extra flag:

1. Right-click on Steam's shortcut icon and select**Properties** .  
![Open Steam Properties in Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/5-open-steam-properties-in-windows.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
2. Go to the**Shortcut** tab in the**Steam Properties** window.  
![Go to Shortcut Tab in the Steam Properties Window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/6-go-to-shortcut-tab-in-the-steam-properties-window.jpg)
3. To modify the**Target** field, click at its end, add a space, and type**"-noreactlogin** .**"**
4. Click**Apply** and then hit**OK** .  
![Click on OK Button After Adding a Launch Parameter in Steam Properties Window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7-click-on-ok-button-after-adding-a-launch-parameter-in-steam-properties-window.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 If you see that some launch parameters are already added to the Target field, consider removing them. According to some users on[GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/9031) , Steam no longer supports the**"noreactlogin"** flag and suggests removing it. Remove this flag if it is already there. Taking this step will ensure that this extra parameter is not contributing to the problem.

## 5\. When Nothing Else Worksâ€¦

 The above fixes should resolve this annoying error. However, if they don't work in your favor, here are a few final fixes you can try.

### Make a New Steam Account and Try Logging In With it

 To confirm that the issue isn't with your Steam account, sign in to Steam using a different account (If you don't have another account, create one). If you successfully log in using the other account, it indicates that your primary account has an issue. So, contact Steam support through their[official Steam Support website](https://help.steampowered.com/en/) and ask them to investigate it.

### Whitelist Steam in All Active Security Apps

 Valve recommends whitelisting Steam's executable files in Windows' built-in or third-party security suites. So, go to Steam's installation folder, filter out all the executable files, and[whitelist them from Windows Defender](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-whitelist-files-windows-defender/) or any other third-party antivirus software you use.

## Get Rid of Steam's Error Code 84 on Windows

 Getting an error code 84 means Steam has failed to log you in. Hopefully, the above fixes will help you resolve the main issue and allow you to sign in successfully. Reinstalling the Steam client should be your last resort if nothing else works. Ensure you create a backup of your game files before uninstalling Steam to avoid losing your progress.
