## What Is DPI Scaling on Windows?

 DPI stands for "dots per inch" and it refers to the number of individual dots that can be packed into an inch of space on your screen. The higher the number, the sharper and clearer the display. But here's the thing, sometimes you might want your text and images to be bigger, while at other times, you might want them smaller. That's where DPI scaling comes in; it's your very own personal adjustment tool.

## How to Change Display DPI Scaling Using the Registry Editor

 If the Settings app isn't working, or you don't have access to it, you can change the scaling through the Registry Editor. But keep in mind that it can be a bit tricky, and you should [back up your registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) before making any changes.

 To change Display DPI Scaling using Registry Editor, follow these steps:

1. Press**Win + R** on your keyboard to [open the Run command](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) .
2. Type**regedit** in the dialog box and hit Enter.
3. If UAC prompts on your screen, click**Yes** to continue.
4. Once you're in the Registry Editor window, navigate to the following path:  
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop
5. In the right pane, right-click on**LogPixels** and select**Modify** from the context menu.  
 If you don't see the LogPixels DWORD key, you need to manually create it. For this, right-click on the empty space in the right pane and select**New > DWORD (32-bit) Value** . Upon creating the DWORD key, give it the name**LogPixels** and save it. Now click twice on the key you just created, and a pop-up will appear.

1. Choose one of the following Value data fields and set the base to**Decimal** .

4. In the pop-up menu, set the Value data to**0** if you set Logpixels to 96, or**1** if you used any other value.
5. Select**Hexadecimal** as the base and click**OK** .

 After performing the above steps, restart your computer to take effect the changes. If you ever need to restore the default settings, just open Registry Editor and go to the same location. Then double-click on Win8DpiScaling and change the Value data to 0.
