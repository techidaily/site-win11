## 2\. iTunes/Apple Music (Windows/Mac)

Besides using Free HD Video Converter to convert .wma to .mp3, you can also convert WMA to MP3 on your computer using Apple Music (iTunes).

Step 2: Change the import settings by clicking on the menu bar and selecting “**Music**” > “**Preferences (Edit)**”.  
Step 3: Click on “**Import Settings**” from the “**Files (General)**” tab and then select “**MP3 Encoder**” from the “**Import Using**” section. Click “**OK**” to confirm the settings.
