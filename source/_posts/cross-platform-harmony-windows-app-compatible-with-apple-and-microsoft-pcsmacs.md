 Windows App is designed to let users access Microsoft's OS through different means on various devices. The Windows App is a hub for Microsoft's desktop and app virtualization services like Azure Virtual Desktop, [Windows 365](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsofts-windows-365-cloud-pc-announced/), and Remote Desktop Services. You can think of it like how the [Microsoft 365 app](https://www.makeuseof.com/top-microsoft-365-app-features/) is the gateway to all your productivity apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

 The Windows App is available in Preview for Windows, macOS, iOS and iPadOS, and web browsers. Before leaving Preview, the app may undergo several changes to become a better version of itself and serve the users better. At the time of writing, the app is not available on Android, but that might change in the future.

## How to Use the Windows App to Connect to a Remote Windows System

 Microsoft specified the operating systems you can run the Windows App on. But since you can open it through a web browser, you can open the Windows App from anywhere, as long as the device can run a modern web browser.

 To open the Windows App on a web browser, visit [windows.cloud.microsoft](https://windows.cloud.microsoft/). You can install the Windows App from the Microsoft Store for Windows devices or TestFlight for Apple devices. For now, you can only sign in with a business or education Microsoft account. The [Windows App documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-app/get-started-connect-devices-desktops-apps) details how you can connect to different devices.

 After installing the app on your device, the first action is to sign in to the app using your work, school, or personal account. It's important to note that you should use the account associated with all the virtual PCs you want to access.

 You don't have to install any other software. But no matter what device you use, the Windows App allows you to take advantage of the peripherals and features on the local device. For instance, you can use multiple monitors, webcam, audio, storage devices, and printer connections with the remote Windows system. The app also supports custom display resolutions, dynamic display resolutions, and scaling.
