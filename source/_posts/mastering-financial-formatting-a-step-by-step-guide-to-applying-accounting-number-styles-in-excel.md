##  What Is the Accounting Number Format?

 At first glance, the accounting number format looks like the currency format. However, there are a few differences between the two.

 Those differences are:

* **Currency Sign**: The accounting number format places the currency sign to the extreme left of the cell.
* **Zeros as Dashes**: Your zeros are displayed as dashes in this number format.
* **Negatives in Parentheses**: The [negative numbers](https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/discover-time-saving-magic-with-these-10-powerful-chatgpt-pdf-extensions/) are displayed in  
        `()`  
      
 (parentheses). Excel does not do this by default.

 All of the methods below let you apply the same accounting number format to your numbers, so use whatever method you find easier to do.

##  Apply the Accounting Number Format With a Ribbon Option

 Excel has an option in its ribbon to help you quickly use the accounting number format in your spreadsheets.

 To use it, first, open your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel. In your spreadsheet, select the cells containing the numbers that you want to turn into accounting numbers.
