## Expert Tips to Re-Enable Your Windows 11 Device After Error 22

 Are you getting the "this device is disabled (Code 22)" error when you connect an external device to your computer? This is a common Device Manager error that prevents you from using the device.

 Fortunately, it's very easy to fix the error code 22 on Windows. Let's look at what the error code 22 means on Windows, some common reasons why it occurs, and how to quickly fix it.

## What Is the “This Device Is Disabled (Code 22)” Error on Windows?

 When you connect an external device to your computer for the first time, Windows installs the driver that is compatible with the device. The device driver then establishes a connection between the removable device and Windows. This allows Windows to identify the device and use it properly.

 However, if you accidentally disable the device driver or it becomes corrupted, the external device will not work properly and may display the error code 22\.

 The error typically occurs when the device driver is disabled or corrupted. However, below are a few other reasons that can trigger this error on Windows:

* An outdated device driver can cause various issues, including error code 22\.
* The error can also crop up if the device isn't compatible with your version of Windows.
* If the device is physically damaged or malfunctioning, Windows will fail to recognize it and throw the error at hand.

 Now that you have a brief knowledge about the "this device is disabled (Code 22)" error, let's explore solutions that will help you fix it.

## 1\. Enable the Device in the Device Manager

 One of the simplest ways to fix error code 22 is to manually enable the device throwing the error. To do that, open the **Device Manager** (check how to [launch Device Manager on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-device-manager/)), right-click on the problematic device, and choose **Properties**. Then, click the **Enable Device** button.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 The Device Manager will refresh, and the device will be back online. Check if you still get the error message. If yes, try the next solution on the list.

## 2\. Check for Physical Damage on the Device

 The error message can also stem from physical damage to your device. To confirm this, look for cracks, dents, or other signs of damage on the device. If you are using a connector, make sure it isn't bent out of shape..

 You should also look for signs of liquid damage, such as corrosion or discoloration on your device. If you find any physical damage, it is likely the culprit behind the error message. In this case, the best thing you can do is to replace the device.

## 3\. Update Your Device Driver

 If your device driver is outdated or corrupt, you may be more likely to experience hardware device issues, such as error code 22\. The solution, in this case, is to update your device driver.

 To do this, open the **Settings app**. On the left side of the window, select **Windows Update**. Then, click the **Check for updates** button.

![Check for updates option in the Settings app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/check-for-updates-1.jpg)

 Your computer will now check the Microsoft servers for updates to your current operating system, including its drivers. If any updates are found, they will be downloaded and installed automatically. Otherwise, you will see a message that says **You're up to date**.

## 4\. Use the Hardware and Device Troubleshooter

 Windows comes with several troubleshooters that can help you fix different problems. One of them is the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter, which, as the name suggests, helps to fix hardware issues.

 While it's not guaranteed to fix the problem, it's worth running when you encounter any hardware-related issues. To run the Hardware and Device troubleshooter, press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog box, type the following command, and press **Enter**:

`msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic`

 Then, check the **Apply repairs automatically** option and click **Next** to step through it.

![Apply repairs automatically option of Hardware troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apply-repairs-automatically.jpg)

 Once the wizard completes, the troubleshooter will let you know of any issues it found and how to fix them.

## 5\. Clear Your Computer's CMOS

 Another way to fix the "this device is disabled (code 22)" error is to clear the CMOS. Doing this will be helpful if a recent change in your BIOS setting is causing the issue. You can clear the CMOS by following the below instructions:

1. Remove all the external devices attached to your PC.
2. Turn off your computer and unplug it from the power outlet.
3. Open the back of your computer.
4. Remove the CMOS battery, wait for a few minutes, and then reconnect the battery. You may need to consult a manual for your PC's motherboard to locate the CMOS battery.

 After that, put back the cover of your computer and plug in all the devices.

## 7\. Perform a Clean Boot

 The next solution on the list is to [perform a clean boot on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/). This will help you rule out third-party applications that might be causing the error.

 After performing a clean boot, your computer will start in a clean state. To check if the error message still appears, try using the device causing the problem. If it doesn't appear, it's time to narrow down the suspects.

 To do that, start re-enabling the services you disabled for performing the clean boot until the error returns. Once you find the problematic service, consider uninstalling it or downloading its update.

## 8\. Perform a System Restore

 If you are still struggling with the error, you can [try a system restore on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/use-system-restore-windows/) to see if that fixes your problem. This will restore your computer to a prior point in time, which is useful if the issue started recently.
