## Innovative Insights: New Folder Formation in Windows 11

 Even if you already know how to create a folder in Windows, knowing how to do it quickly and efficiently can help you be more productive and efficient when working with your computer.

 Whether you prefer the simplicity of using the context menu or the speed of a keyboard shortcut, there are several ways to create new folders in Windows 11\. This post will discuss four easy methods for creating new folders in Windows 11.

## 1\. Create a New Folder Using the Context Menu

 The easiest and most well-known way to create a new folder on Windows is through the context menu. You can use this method to create folders nearly anywhere in Windows. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Head over to the location where you want to create the folder.
2. Right-click anywhere on an empty space to open the context menu.
3. Select**New > Folder** .
4. Type in a suitable name for your folder and then press**Enter** .

## 2\. Create a New Folder Using File Explorer

 File Explorer's menu bar provides access to many useful options. One of them also lets you create a new folder with a couple of mouse clicks.

To create a new folder using File Explorer's menu:

1. Press**Win + E** or use one of[many ways to open File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) .
2. Navigate to the location where you want to create a new folder.
3. Click the**New** button in the top-left corner of File Explorer and select**Folder** from the list.
4. Give your folder a suitable name, and then press**Enter** .

## 3\. Create a New Folder With a Keyboard Shortcut

 If you prefer to work with the keyboard rather than a mouse, or if you simply want to create a new folder faster, you can use the**Ctrl + Shift + N** keyboard shortcut on Windows.

 Simply head to the location where you want to create the folder and press**Ctrl + Shift + N** together on your keyboard. Once the folder is created, you can rename it to anything you want.

## 4\. Create a New Folder With Command Prompt or PowerShell

 Another way to create folders on Windows is via a command-line utility. While it may not be as quick as the other methods mentioned above, it can certainly come in handy if you need to[create multiple folders at once](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-11-create-multiple-folders/) .

 You can use Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell to create new folders on Windows. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Use the**Win + S** keyboard shortcut to open Windows Search.
2. Type**Command Prompt** or**PowerShell** in the search box and select**Run as administrator** .
3. Select**Yes** when the[User Account Control (UAC) prompt](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-disable-user-account-control-prompt/) appears.
4. In the console, type the following command and press**Enter** to navigate to the location where you want to create a new folder. Make sure you replace**Directory** in the following command with the actual directory location where you want to create the folder.  
`cd Directory`
5. Next, type**mkdir** followed by the name of the folder you wish to create and press**Enter** . For instance, if you were to create a folder named**Work** , you'd type the following command:  
`mkdir Work`

6. Likewise, if you want to create multiple folders, type**mkdir** followed by the names of your folders. For instance, if you wanted to create three folders named**Android** ,**iPhone** , and**Windows** , you'd enter this command:  
`mkdir Android iPhone Windows`
