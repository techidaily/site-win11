## Behind the Veil of User Interface: Accessing Windows’ Hidden Personality Editor

 The Private Character Editor is a Microsoft Windows program that lets you create, edit, and manage custom fonts. You can use this tool to create symbols and other characters that are not included in the standard Windows character set. Although the Private Character Editor isn't as popular as other font creation tools, you can use it to create custom fonts.

 If you want to change the way your characters look on Windows, you can do so by opening the Private Character Editor. Here's a quick guide that will help.

## 1\. How to Open the Private Character Editor Using Windows Settings

1. Press**Win + I** to launch the Settings app.
