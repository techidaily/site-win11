### Key Takeaways

* Microsoft has extended support for Windows 11 version 22H2, providing extra time for optional updates.
* Different editions of Windows 11 22H2 have varying end-of-support dates, so check which version you're using.
* Users should not delay upgrading to the latest version of Windows 11 to ensure continued updates.

 When Microsoft declares an end-of-support date, it usually sticks to it. However, in rare instances, Microsoft will change this date. Such is the case with Windows 11 version 22H2, which has been given a time extension for optional updates. But what does that mean, both in terms of Windows 11 generally and for your own computer?

## What's Happening to Windows 11 22H2's End of Support Date?

 As reported by [XDA Developers](https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-11-22h2-optional-update-deadline/), Microsoft announced a change to its end-of-support date for Windows 11 version 22H2\. Note that this will not affect your machine if you've updated it recently; 22H2 was released in September 2022, and some people have deliberately prevented Windows 11 from updating so they can stay on version 22H2\.

 Microsoft originally intended to automatically move everyone on Windows 11 version 22H2 over to 23H2 before the older version fell out of support on February 27, 2024\. However, Microsoft went back on its original plan and extended the amount of time people had before 22H2 hit end-of-support. Until then, Windows 11 22H2 will continue receiving optional updates.

 Different versions of Windows 11 will get different deadlines for end-of-support. As per [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/february-29-2024-kb5034848-os-builds-22621-3235-and-22631-3235-preview-5b718126-82b1-4e14-bf01-da3500a3fc88#:~:text=Home%2C%20Pro%2C%20Pro%20Education%2C,of%20Windows%2011%2C%20version%2022H2.):

> The new end date is June 24, 2025 for Windows 11, version 22H2 Enterprise, Education, IoT Enterprise, and Enterprise multi-session editions. Home, Pro, Pro Education, and Pro for Workstations editions of version 22H2 will receive non-security preview updates until June, 26, 2024\.
>
> After these dates, only cumulative monthly security updates will continue for the supported editions of Windows 11, version 22H2\.

 According to Microsoft, this change occurred due to user feedback.

### Defining an "Optional Update" in Windows

 Windows updates aren't all equal; there's a system that differentiates them depending on how important they are. This deadline extension will allow people to receive non-critical updates on Windows 11 version 22H2 until the new date, and security updates will continue for even longer.

 Check out our guide to [what Windows optional updates are](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-optional-updates-guide/) for more information about them.

## What Does This Mean for Windows 11 22H2 Users?

 If you're still using a Windows 11 22H2 machine, you have a bit more time before Microsoft stops updating your PC with optional features. How much time depends on what version of Windows 11 you're using; as we covered above, this will vary depending on the version.

 If you're using a home computer, the extension gives you only a few more months to make the jump. As such, it's a good idea not to rest on your laurels and upgrade to the latest version of Windows 11 when you can. For business cases, you've got over a year of extra time, so use this time to get your systems ready for the latest version of Windows.

 Still, if you can't make the jump right away, it's not the end of the world. An operating system isn't truly deemed "dead" until the company stops supplying security patches. Once this happens, any exploits hackers find won't be patched by the company, and you'll be on your own. It's one of the plenty of [reasons why you shouldn't use an old version of Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-you-shouldnt-use-old-windows/).

 As per [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-11-home-and-pro), Windows Home and Pro will continue getting security updates until October 4, 2024, while the business editions get until October 14, 2025\. You can count this as the "hard deadline," after which you should either upgrade or change the operating system. However, it's always good to be proactive and make the jump as soon as possible (once any initial issues have been patched up).

## Should You Upgrade to the Current Version of Windows 11?

 It's best not to take this extension as a sign to simply continue using Windows 11 22H2\. Even business-level versions of Windows 11 will still meet the end-of-life date eventually; once that arrives, you're essentially on the operating system's last legs until the security patches go away. As such, now would be a fantastic time to get your copy of Windows 11 up to date so you can continue receiving security and feature updates.

 If you're not upgrading to a new version of Windows 11 due to your dislike of the operating system, you can use this time to experiment with a new one. There are plenty of [free alternatives to Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/free-alternatives-to-windows-operating-systems/) you can try, and grabbing one of these will keep your PC secure after the cutoff date.

 Whichever path you take, Microsoft has given everyone a little bit more time with Windows 11 22H2\. And while it's safe to use your home PC until October 2024, it'll be a lot less stressful to bite the bullet now so you can continue receiving updates and get the latest on your Windows system.

 When Microsoft declares an end-of-support date, it usually sticks to it. However, in rare instances, Microsoft will change this date. Such is the case with Windows 11 version 22H2, which has been given a time extension for optional updates. But what does that mean, both in terms of Windows 11 generally and for your own computer?
