## Reactivating a Non-Functional Windows 11 Search Box in the UI

 Windows 11 Settings app is stuffed with plenty of control options. And there are high chances that you might get lost in so many options. In such scenarios, the Search strip in the Settings app comes in handy, as it helps you find the exact control quickly in the Settings app.

 But what if the Search is not working in the Settings app? In this article, we are putting together a list of fixes you can try when Search is not working in Windows 11 Settings app.

## 1\. Restart Your Device

 A restart can fix many issues that are plaguing your system. When you restart your PC, you are essentially instructing it to start with a clean slate, leaving behind issues that might be causing trouble. Restarting your PC can also fix the Search issue in the Settings app.

 However, if your PC frequently requires a restart to fix this issue, the underlying problem affecting the Search feature in the Settings app persists. In that case, you should look for a more robust solution.

1. Click the Start icon and type "Settings."
2. Right-click on**Settings** , and then click**App settings** .
