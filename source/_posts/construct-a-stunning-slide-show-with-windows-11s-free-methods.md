This is how you can create image slideshows with Windows Media Player:

1. First, make sure your user Pictures folder includes the photos you want in a slideshow. You can move photos into the user Pictures folder by dragging and dropping them from one directory to the other in File Explorer.
2. Type**Windows Media Player** inside the Start menu’s search box.
3. Select**Windows Media Player** to bring up that software’s window.
4. Click the**Create playlist** button.
5. Type**Image Slideshow** in the playlist text box.
6. Then click the small arrow beside**Playlist** to extend that category.
7. Click the**Pictures** on the left of the Windows Media Player window.  
![Selected slideshow images in Windows Media Player](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pictures-in-windows-media-player.jpg)
8. Hold the**Ctrl** key and select photos to include within the slideshow.
9. Then hold the left mouse button to drag your image selection onto your playlist’s title in the Windows Media Player sidebar.

![Selected slideshow images in Windows Media Player](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pictures-in-windows-media-player.jpg)

 Now select your Image Slideshow playlist in Windows Media Player, which will include the photo files you’ve added to it. Click the**Play** button to start the slideshow. Windows Media Player will then display play a basic slideshow that flicks through the images in it at about five-second intervals.

## Who Needs Third-Party Photo Slideshow Software?

 So, it’s hardly essential to install third-party slideshow software in Windows 11 when you can show off your favorite pics with the methods above. Windows 11’s built-in desktop and screensaver slideshow features and Google Photos are ok for showcasing basic image collections. You can set up more advanced photography slideshows that incorporate variable transition effects, background music, audio narrative, and text captions with Video Editor and Google Sheets.
