##  Add the Data Analysis Tool in Excel

 While you can perform calculations and create a line graph to display your moving average in Excel, there's an easier way.

 Microsoft offers a free [Analysis ToolPak](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-the-analysis-toolpak-to-perform-complex-data-analysis-6c67ccf0-f4a9-487c-8dec-bdb5a2cefab6?ns=excel&version=90&syslcid=1033&uilcid=1033&appver=zxl900&helpid=xladdin.chm1780&ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) that you can add to Excel. The tool lets you develop statistical or engineering analyses with a variety of functions. One such option is a moving average.

 To see if you already have the Analysis ToolPak, go to the Data tab and look for the Data Analysis button in the Analysis section of the ribbon.

 If you have the button, you're good to go and can move on to calculating a moving average below. If not, here's you can add it quickly.

 Go to the Search box at the top of Excel and enter "Add-ins." When you see Add-ins in the list, select it.

![Go to File, Options, Add-ins](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/OptionsExcelAddIns-ExcelMovingAverage.png) 

 After the Add-ins window displays, check the box next to Analysis ToolPak and click "OK."
