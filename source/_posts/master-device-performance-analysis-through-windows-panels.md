[Dev Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/dev-home-windows-11-introduction/) is a specialized app created for software developers who use Windows 11\.

 Within Dev Home, you'll find a customizable dashboard equipped with widgets that offer valuable insights into your system resources. These widgets cover essential aspects such as:

* **Memory**: Keep track of memory usage, availability, and pool sizes.
* **Network**: Monitor bandwidth usage for data transfer and identify the active network.
* **CPU**: Stay informed about CPU utilization, processing speed, and active processes.
* **GPU**: Get updates on GPU utilization, temperature, and the model of the graphics chip.

 These widgets serve as handy tools to closely monitor and optimize your system's performance. To access them, simply [download Dev Home from the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/dev-home-preview/9N8MHTPHNGVV) and set it up.
