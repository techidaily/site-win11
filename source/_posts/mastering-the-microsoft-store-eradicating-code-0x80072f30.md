## Mastering the Microsoft Store: Eradicating Code 0X80072F30

 You can download and install a multitude of Windows 11/10 apps when you access Microsoft Store. However, some users can’t utilize MS Store because of a 0x80072F30 error. Those users see an error message that says "Check your connection… Code: 0x80072F30" whenever they open MS Store.

 That error can arise even when there are no general internet connection issues for affected PCs. So, some users are a little baffled by it. However, you can resolve error 0x80072F30 in Windows 11 and 10 with these potential fixes.

## 1\. Run the Troubleshooter for Windows Store Apps

 First, start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter. That troubleshooter may not detect and address issues with MS Store, but it’s worth a try. You can launch that troubleshooting tool in Windows 11 like this:

1. [Open S](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) e [ttings](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) with the app’s handy**Win** +**I** keyboard shortcut. See [how to open Windows Settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) for more handy methods.
2. Next, click Settings'**Troubleshoot** navigation option in the**System** tab.  
![The Run button for the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-run-button-for-the-app-troubleshooter.jpg)
3. Click**Other-troubleshooters** to access Windows 11’s troubleshooting tools.
4. Press Windows Store App’s**Run** button to see if that troubleshooter detects any issues.  
![The Windows Store Apps troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/windows-store-apps-troubleshooter.jpg)
5. Apply any possible manual fixes the troubleshooter suggests.

 Opening the same troubleshooting tools in Windows 10 is a little different. You’ll need to select**Update & Security** \>**Troubleshoot** in Windows 10’s Settings app. Then click the**Additional troubleshooters** navigation link to reach the troubleshooting tools.

 Some additional networking troubleshooters might also be useful for fixing error 0x80072F30 in some cases. The Network Adapter and Internet Connections troubleshooters are two available in Settings. So, select to run those troubleshooters as well.

## 2\. Reset the Cache for Microsoft Store

 Microsoft Store has a cache that stores accumulated data. Corrupted data in that cache can often cause MS Store errors to occur. So, maybe resetting that cache might help for resolving error 0x80072F30\. This is how to reset MS Store’s cache:

1. Press the**Win** +**S** keyboard buttons simultaneously to access a search tool.
2. Type**wsreset.exe** inside the text box to find that run command.  
![A wsreset.exe search command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/a-wsreset-search.jpg)
3. Select**wsreset.exe** to initiate the command.
4. Restart Windows after resetting MS Store’s cache.

## 3\. Check the Windows Update Service

 Windows Update is a necessary background service for Microsoft Store. So, check that the Windows Update service is enabled and running. If it’s not running, set that service to automatic and start it as follows:

1. Bring up the search tool in Windows 11 or 10, and input the keyword services there.
2. Select**Services** to access that app’s window.
3. Double-click**Windows Update** to view its properties window.

## 4\. Check the Date & Time Settings on Your PC

 MS Store is an app for which correct time and date settings on your PC are important. Issues often occur when the MS Store app’s time is not in sync with that of your PC. You can check your PC’s date and time by glancing at its system tray clock. Follow these steps if it looks like you might need to readjust your PC’s time settings:

1. Open the window for the Settings app.
2. Click the**Time & language** tab or category inside Settings.
3. Turn off the**Set the time automatically** option if enabled.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. Select the**Change** option for manually setting the date and time.
5. Input the correct time and date for the region your PC is set to. You can check the right time and date for your PC’s set region at the [World Clock](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/) website.  
![The Change the date & time window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-change-date-time-window.jpg)
6. Then select**Change** to set the new time.
7. Also, make sure the time zone is set right by disabling the**Set time zone automatically** option and choosing an option on the**Time Zone** drop-down menu.
8. Then select to restart Windows after correcting the time settings.

## 5\. Turn Off Any Active Proxy Server Settings

 A [proxy server](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-a-proxy-server/) is an intermediary server through which data traffic flows when enabled on your PC. That can cause MS Store connection issues that only disabling a proxy will resolve. So, it could be the case a proxy server is causing error 0x80072F30 on your PC.

 Even if you’re positive you’ve never enabled such a feature, check the proxy server setting like this:

1. First, bring up the Run app launcher (pressing the**Win** +**R** key combo will launch it).
2. Then type**inetcpl.cpl** inside the**Open** command box.
3. Click**OK** to view Internet Options.
4. Select that window’s**Connections** tab.

2. Click**View network connections** in the search results.
3. Right-click your internet connection there and select its**Properties** option.

## 7\. Reinstall the Microsoft Store App

 The final solution for error 0x80072F30 is to reinstall MS Store. You can’t reinstall Microsoft Store like a standard app. However, you can effectively reinstall Microsoft Store by executing a PowerShell command in the following steps:

2. Enter**Windows Powershell** to find that command-line shell app.
3. Select the**Run as administrator** option for PowerShell inside the search tool.
4. Then input this command for reinstalling the Microsoft Store:  
`Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.WindowsStore | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register &ldquo;$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml&rdquo;}`  
![The reinstall Microsoft Store command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-reinstall-powershell-command.jpg)
