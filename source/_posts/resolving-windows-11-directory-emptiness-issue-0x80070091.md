## 1\. Try Erasing the Folder With the Command Prompt

 The Command Prompt gives users another way to delete folders in Windows 11/10\. So, you might be able to erase an affected folder without issues by using the Command Prompt. Using the Command Prompt might be more of a workaround, but at least you’ll get the folder deleted if works.

 Run Command Prompt with elevated (administrative) rights. Our guide about[running Command Prompt as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/) includes numerous methods for launching that app. Then input this command and press**Enter** to delete an affected folder:

`rmdir /s "folder path"`

 You’ll need to replace**folder path** in that command with the location of whatever directory you need to delete. The location should include a drive letter and a full path for the directory like in this example:

`rmdir /s "C:\Users\New folder"`

## 2\. Restart Windows File Explorer

 Restarting File Explorer can resolve issues that occur with that file manager. However, closing and reopening the Explorer window doesn’t restart the file manager. You’ll need to restart the Explorer process via Task Manager like this:

1. To view Task Manager, press**Ctrl** +**Shift** +**Esc** simultaneously.
2. Select File Explorer on the**Processes** tab.  
![The Restart option for File Explorer](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/restart-options-for-file-explorer.jpg)
3. Press the**Restart** button for the selected Explorer process.

## 3\. Scan System Files With an SFC Scan

 Error 0x80070091 can be caused by some corrupted system files that need repairing. Running an SFC scan might both detect and repair corrupted system files and fix error 0x80070091 in the process. You can scan with SFC as instructed in our post for[running the System File Checker tool](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/) .

## 4\. Check for Errors With a Disk Scan

1. Open up the Command Prompt window with administrative rights.
2. Type in this Check Disk command and press**Enter:**

 If the folder the 0x80070091 error occurs for isn’t on the C: drive, you’ll need to modify the above command. Replace**C:** with the letter of the storage drive that includes the affected folder.

## 5\. Modify the Affected Folder’s Permissions

 Error 0x80070091 can arise because of insufficient folder permission. You might need to set an affected folder to full permission to resolve error 0x80070091\. To do that, change the folder’s permission settings as follows:

1. Open Explorer and right-click the affected folder to select**Properties** .  
![The Properties option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/properties-option.jpg)
