## Perfecting User Authentication Management for Domains in W11

 Biometric authentication allows you to quickly log in to the system using fingerprint, facial, or iris recognition. However, what if you want to prevent a domain user from logging in using biometrics?

 This article will show some quick ways to allow or block a domain user from logging on using biometrics in Windows 11\.

## How to Allow or Block a Biometrics Log-On via the Local Group Policy Editor

 The quickest way to configure your computer to allow or block a biometrics scan for domain users is through the Local Group Policy Editor. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Press the **Win + R** key to open the **Run tool.**
2. Type **gpedit.msc** in the search bar and click OK.
3. In the Local Group Policy Editor, head towards the following location:  
`Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Biometrics`
4. Double-click on the **Allow domain users to log on using biometrics** policy in the right pane.

## How to Allow or Block a Biometrics Log-On Using the Registry Editor

 Another way to configure biometrics log-on for the domain users is through the Registry Editor. Here's how:

 Editing the registry is risky, as one wrong edit can make your system unstable. Therefore, make sure to [back up the registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) and [create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) before proceeding with the steps.

1. Open the Run tool, type **regedit** in the search bar, and press Enter.
2. In the Registry Editor, navigate to the following location:  
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Biometrics\Credential Provider`
3. Right-click the **Credential Provider** key in the left sidebar, hover the cursor to **New,** and choose **DWORD (32-bit) Value**.
