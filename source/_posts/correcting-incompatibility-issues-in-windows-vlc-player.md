## Correcting Incompatibility Issues in Windows, VLC Player

 It is not often that VLC Media Player fails to play a file. But sometimes, when you try to open a media file, you may encounter the "your input canâ€™t be opened" error on VLC. This error can occur with both local media files and when you try to stream a YouTube video, albeit for different reasons.

 Invalid file or folder name, issues with the VLC media player, and issues with YouTube.luac file are the common causes of this error. If you experience this error, here are a few quick fixes to resolve the "your input canâ€™t be opened" VLC error on Windows.

 If the error occurs when streaming a YouTube video, skip to the fourth solution in this guide.

## 1\. Change the File/Folder Path

![copy folder file move windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/copy-folder-file-move-windows-11.jpg)

 The "your input canâ€™t be opened" error can occur if the folder path for the saved media is too long. For example, if your file is saved in D:\\Users\\Downloads\\Media\\New\\Files, moving it to a main folder such as**D:\\Users** can fix the issue.

To move the media file to a different folder:

1. Press**Win + E** to open**File Explorer** .
2. Next, navigate to the folder where your media files are saved.
3. Right-click on the media file and select**Copy** .
4. Next, create a new folder in**D:\\Users** and paste the file. Now open the file to see if it plays without the error.
