## 1\. How to Update Your Audio Driver via Device Manager

 The Device Manager is a built-in Windows applet that lets you manage all the hardware and its associated drivers of your PC, all from one place. You can even[use the Device Manager to diagnose issues on Windows 10](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-device-manager-windows-10/) .

 To access the Device Manager, head to the**Start menu** search bar, type in ‘device manager,’ and select the best match.

 The Device Manager will be launched. From there, click on the dropdown menu of**Sound, video, and game controllers** .

 Now, find the name of your audio device. Search online for the driver using the name of the audio device, and be sure to only download drivers from official sources.

 Usually, you can double-click a downloaded driver and it will install itself. If this doesn't work, right-click on the audio driver in Device Manager and select**Update driver** . Then, select**Browse my computer for drivers** , navigate to where you downloaded the new driver, and select it.

As soon as you do this, Windows will install the new audio drivers.

## 2\. How to Update Your Audio Driver Through Windows Update

 If the Device Manager fails to work for you, then trying another method is in order. Windows Update, the free update and maintenance service by Microsoft, is your next best bet for this. Whenever you update your Windows, the Windows Update also looks up (and downloads) any driver updates that will be available to it.

 To get started with Windows Update, head to the**Start menu** search bar, type in ‘settings,’ and select the best match. Alternatively, press**Win + I** . Then, from the left menu, click on the**Windows Update** option.

 On the Windows Update screen, click on**Check for updates** . Your Windows will start looking for updates released by Microsoft and update your audio drivers with new patches as soon as possible.
