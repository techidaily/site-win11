## Reverse OneDrive Lockout: Windows User Guide Needed

 There was a time when managing Windows files was daunting. With the advent of cloud storage services such as Microsoft’s OneDrive, storage and sharing have become easier. However, sometimes you may face sign-in issues with OneDrive on Windows devices. Read on to learn more about Microsoft OneDrive and how to resolve sign-in problems.

## Why Can’t You Sign Into OneDrive?

 There are several reasons why your Windows device may not sign in to OneDrive. It includes faulty installations, incorrect credentials, and outdated software.

 Here are some possible reasons you can't log in:

1. An outdated OneDrive version.
2. An unstable or no internet connection.
3. You're running an older Windows version.
4. There are corrupted cache files within OneDrive.

## 1\. Check Your Internet Connection

 Your device needs an active internet connection to stay connected to Microsoft’s servers. So, if you’re having trouble signing in to your Microsoft OneDrive account, check your internet connection. To do this, open the default web browser and load a page. If the page fails to load, your internet connection is likely the problem.

 If you're getting unreliable internet service, check out this guide on [fixing unstable internet connections](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-slow-unstable-wi-fi-connection/).

## 2\. Clear the OneDrive Cache

 Like any other application, OneDrive stores certain data locally to improve performance. If this data becomes corrupted, you may experience sign-in problems. In this case, clearing the OneDrive cache should help.

 To clear the OneDrive cache, do the following:

1. [Open File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) and navigate to the following:  
C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive
2. In the path above, replace **Username** with your user account name. If AppData isn't visible, make sure you enable **Hidden items** from the View ribbon.  
 Alternatively, open the command prompt with admin access, type **%localappdata%\\Microsoft\\OneDrive\\onedrive.exe /reset** in the text field. Then hit **Enter** on your keyboard. This will open the location where OneDrive stores its cache files.
3. Once you’re in the OneDrive folder, press **Ctrl + A** to select all items and hit the **Delete** key.

 Doing so will reset all OneDrive settings on your computer, including stored sign-in information.

## 3\. Unlink and Re-Link Your OneDrive Account

 If you have multiple OneDrive accounts, you should unlink your current account and relink it. This may help resolve account-related issues.

 To unlink OneDrive, do the following:

1. Go to the Taskbar and click the OneDrive icon in the system tray.
2. In the pop-up window, click the gear icon.
3. Select **Settings** from the options list.
4. From the Settings menu, click the **Account** tab.
5. Under your account, click **Unlink this PC**.

 Once you’ve unlinked OneDrive, you can re-link your account. To do this, go back to the **Account** tab in OneDrive Settings and click the **Add an account** button. Enter your Microsoft account credentials to sign in and re-link your account.

## 4\. Reset the OneDrive App

 If you still can’t log in to OneDrive, chances are the OneDrive app is corrupted. To fix this, you’ll need to reset the OneDrive app completely.

 To reset the OneDrive app, press **Win + X** on your keyboard and select **Installed apps** from the power user menu. Under Installed apps, click the three dots icon next to **OneDrive** and select **Advanced options**. You can also use the search bar to find OneDrive.

 On the next screen, scroll down to the **Reset** section and click **Reset**. If prompted, click the **Reset** button again to confirm the action. After OneDrive is reset, you can now sign in with your Microsoft account and access your files.

## 5\. Disable Any Active Proxy or VPN Connections

 If you're using a proxy or virtual private network (VPN) connection, try disabling it. Sometimes proxies and VPNs can interfere with OneDrive's authentication process, so disabling them could solve the problem.

 To disable the Proxy, do the following:

1. [Open the Settings menu](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/).
2. From the left pane, select **Network & internet > Proxy**.
3. Toggle off **Automatically detect settings**.  
![Disable Proxy](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/disable-proxy.jpg)
4. Next to **Use a proxy server**, click the **Setup** button.
5. Then turn **Use a proxy server** off.
6. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

 Once the Proxy is disabled, it's time to disable your VPN connection.

 To do this, open Settings and then navigate to **Network & internet** \> **VPN**. Select your VPN connection and then click the **Disconnect** button.

 After disabling both the Proxy and VPN, restart your computer and try signing in to OneDrive again.

## 6\. Reinstall OneDrive

 You can also try uninstalling and reinstalling the application. This will re-create the local files and resolve any sign-in issues. This will re-create the local files and resolve any sign-in issues.

 To uninstall OneDrive, do the following:

1. Press **Win + I** on your keyboard to open System Settings.
2. In the Settings menu, Select **Apps > Installed apps**.
3. Scroll down to **OneDrive** and click the three dots next to it.
4. Click **Uninstall** from the context menu.

5. If a popup menu appears, click **Uninstall** again and follow the instructions to complete the process. You don't need to worry about your files since they’ll be synced once you sign in.

 After uninstalling, you can [download OneDrive from Microsoft’s official website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/download). Once the application is installed, try signing in to OneDrive and seeing if it solves the issue.

## 7\. Check for a New Windows Update

 If none of the solutions above work, it’s time to check for a Windows update. Microsoft regularly releases Windows updates to fix existing problems and security vulnerabilities.

 If you’re running an outdated Windows version, this could also be the reason why you can’t sign into OneDrive. Here’s how to do it:

1. Click on Start and select **Settings** in the pinned items list.
2. Select **Windows Update** from the left sidebar.
3. Now go to the right and click **Check for updates**.  
![Check for updates](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/check-for-updates.jpg)

 If there’s a newer Windows version available, the computer will automatically download it for you. Once updated, restart your computer and try signing in to OneDrive again.

## 8\. Verify Your Microsoft Account

 No matter how many times you try, OneDrive won't sign in if it is suspended or locked. This can happen due to suspicious activities, such as an unauthorized login attempt.

 To make sure this isn’t the case, [verify your Microsoft account](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-account-recovery-form/). Once verified, try signing in to OneDrive again and it should work now.
