## Boosting Productivity with Descriptive Folders in Windows 11

 Do you want to add extra details to your PC's folders with comments? Here’s how you can add info for a folder to the **Comments** column in Windows 11 File Explorer.

 File Explorer has a **Comments** column in which users can add comments to files within Explorer by modifying tags for them on the Details tab. However, folders don’t have editable tags like files do. Nevertheless, you can still add comments to folders even though File Explorer doesn’t have a built-in option for doing so.

## How to Enable File Explorer's Comments Column

 First, you must set File Explorer to show the **Comments** column that will include the comment for a folder. That column isn’t enabled by default within Explorer. Enable the **Comments** column for a folder as follows.

1. [Open File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) and go to the directory containing the folder you want to add a comment to.
2. Right-click on the **Type** column, or any other, and select **More**.

3. Select the **Comments** checkbox in the Choose Details window.

4. Click **OK** to add the **Comments** column.

 A **Comments** column will now be visible in the directory opened. That is where you’ll see the comment added to a folder. You can expand the width of that column by placing the mouse cursor on the left or right side of the **Comments** column header, holding the left mouse button, and dragging the mouse cursor.

## How to Reveal the desktop.ini File for a Folder

 Desktop.ini is a hidden configuration file for folders. So, you must [set Explorer to show hidden files](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-show-hidden-files-folders/) to see and edit desktop.ini. You will also need to [change the icon of the folder](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/customize-icon-windows/) to which you want to add a comment to make its desktop.ini file visible. These are the steps for revealing a folder’s desktop.ini file:

1. Click on the **See more** menu button on Explorer’s command bar.
2. Select **Options** to bring up a window that includes folder settings.

## How to Add a New Folder Comment With the Desktop.Ini File

 Now you’ll be able to see the desktop.ini file within the folder to which you want to set a custom comment. You can add a custom comment for that folder by editing its desktop.ini file as follows:

1. Open the folder for which you changed the icon.
2. Right-click the **desktop.ini** file in that folder and select **Open with**.
3. Select **Notepad** in the submenu.

4. Enter **InfoTip=Add your comment here** in the line just beneath **\[.ShellClassInfo\]** within Notepad. You can change the **Add your comment here** text to whatever you want the comment for your folder to say.

7. Click Exit on Notepad’s **File** menu.
8. Finally, restart the Windows Explorer process with a method in this guide to restarting File Explorer.

 Return to the directory that includes the folder to which you’ve just added a comment. You’ll see the custom comment for the folder in the **Comments** column. You can add comments to many more folders by changing their icons and editing the desktop.ini files in them. Note that you’ll also need to enable the **Comments** column for each directory.

 If you ever want to remove or change the comment, reopen the desktop.ini file in the set folder. You can remove the comment by deleting the InfoTip comment text. Or edit the comment’s text there to change it.

## Add Useful Comment Info to Your Folders on Windows 11

 You can now add extra information about your folders within File Explorer with comment notes. Such comments can be useful for making it clearer what directories include. For example, you can add comments that provide more specific details about what kinds of files folders include. Or add comments about what specific files you can find in them.

 File Explorer has a **Comments** column in which users can add comments to files within Explorer by modifying tags for them on the Details tab. However, folders don’t have editable tags like files do. Nevertheless, you can still add comments to folders even though File Explorer doesn’t have a built-in option for doing so.
