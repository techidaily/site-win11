 The annual Microsoft Store App Awards has the tech giant showcasing winning apps from various categories. The 2023 awards edition also featured the best apps handpicked by Microsoft editors in the categories of Creativity, Entertainment, Productivity, and Best Integration with Windows and one outstanding app that deserved Special Recognition.

 So, if you're looking for the best apps for your Windows PC, what could be better than those having the Microsoft editor's approval?

## What Are the Microsoft Store App Awards?

 Launched in 2022, the Microsoft Store App Awards has the tech giant inviting users worldwide to nominate their favorite apps from the Microsoft Store. These nominee apps are then evaluated, tested, and chosen by Microsoft editors based on their user experience, exceptional design, innovation, creativity, overall quality, and customer value.

 The winners of the 2023 awards edition are some groundbreaking apps that will empower you to connect, create, and work better than ever on Windows.

## Ava Accessibility: Special Recognition Winner

![Ava Accessibility App on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ava-accessibility.jpg)

 Microsoft constantly keeps innovating and adding [features to make Windows more accessible](https://www.makeuseof.com/guide-to-accessibility-tools-windows/) to individuals with problems of vision, hearing, dexterity, mobility, focus, and more. The 2023 Microsoft Store Special Recognition winner Ava Accessibility reflects the same spirit to make Windows more inclusive for users who are deaf or hard of hearing.

 Ava Accessibility captions live conversations to provide accessibility to hearing-impaired people. Combined with simple and user-friendly features and intuitive interface, this Special Recognition winner will enable you or your hearing-impaired loved ones to work, learn, connect, and enjoy on Windows.

 The app features Ava CC for Windows which offers the highest possible accuracy of up to 99% with Ava Scribe. You or your loved ones can use Ava CC to transcribe or live caption voice-to-text for classrooms and business meetings. Or use it to enjoy gameplay on Twitch, connect with your favorite communities on Discord, or chat with your team on Google Meet, Slack, or Microsoft Teams.

 Plus you'll never miss out on YouTube and other live videos and your favorite podcasts—Ava will transcribe them all for you. Additionally, you and your loved ones can invite friends and colleagues to your conversation so they can connect with you instantly.

 With Ava CC, you will get a real-time color-coded transcript of who is saying what. And with Ava Text-to-Speech you can also easily type out what you want to say.

 Moreover, thoughtful features like Ava Floating Caption Box, Ava Vocabulary Boost to make Ava learn words that you use, and the Ava mobile app for on-the-go captions make Ava Accessibility a reliable companion for hearing-impaired individuals.

## Descript: Creativity Winner

![Descript App on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/descript.jpg)

 If you've edited videos earlier, it was probably with timeline editors where you drag and drop audio and video clips to a timeline. Descript is a path-breaking app that changes the way you edit videos. It simplifies video editing by automatically transcribing recordings so you can easily edit them just like editing a Word doc.

 Just upload your videos to instantly transcribe them. Then, make changes to the text to directly edit your media clips. It's like you have the script of the video before you, split up into clips of the scenes. This way, you can edit the script and then check the clips to review the changes.

 This ability to streamline complex, multi-track A/V editing in a novel and accessible way made Descript the winning Creativity choice of Microsoft editors. You can even record your screen and webcam directly in Descript and convert those recordings into text. Descript transcriptions are fast and accurate, and the app includes automatic speaker detection.

 Moreover, Descript has AI-powered features like Overdub, a personalized text-to-speech voice synthesis for minor recording fixes. Thanks to AI, you can also automatically edit out filler words like uhhs and umms and silence gaps with a single click.

 With Descript, you have a powerful tool to create outstanding video recordings, whether it's a pitch to a client, a podcast, or the next viral video sensation.
