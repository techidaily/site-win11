## Boosting RDC Usability in the Latest OS

 Remote Desktop Connection is Windows 11’s built-in app for connecting to remote computers. You can use it to remotely access another PC, which comes in handy for personal or support-related use. In Windows 11 Professional and Enterprise editions, you can also enable Remote Desktop to set up a host PC for remote computing.

 To connect to a remote PC, you’ll need to open the Remote Desktop Connection tool. Once done, you can then enter the login credentials for the remote PC to connect to it through the Remote Desktop Connection window. As such, let's explore how to enable the Remote Desktop Connection tool on Windows 11

## How to Enable Remote Desktop Connection on Windows 11

 If you want your PC to be a host computer, you’ll need to [enable Remote Desktop](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-set-up-microsofts-remote-desktop-connection/) on that PC's copy of Windows 11\. Note that you can only activate that feature in Enterprise and Professional editions of Microsoft’s latest desktop platform, as is also the case for Windows 10\. You can enable Remote Desktop as follows:

1. Click the taskbar’s **Start** button.
2. Open the **Settings** app that’s pinned to the Start menu.
3. Select the **Remote Desktop** navigation option.
4. Click the **Remote Desktop** option to turn it on.  
![The Remote Desktop option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/remote-desktop-option.png)
5. Select the **Confirm** option on the Remote Desktop Settings prompt.
6. As an optional extra, click the small arrow beside the Remote Desktop toggle button. Then select the **Require devices to use Network Level Authentication Connect (Recommended)** option.

 Thereafter, you can connect to your host PC remotely with other computers and mobile devices. To do so, you’ll need to enter the required login credentials for it and enter them into the remote access software. On Windows desktops and laptops, you can do that by opening the built-in Remote Desktop Connection accessory.

## 1\. Open Remote Desktop Connection With the Windows 11 Search Tool

 Windows 11’s search tool is a handy way to find software, files, and other accessories on your PC. As such, you can use it to find and open Remote Desktop Connection.

1. To open the search tool, click the magnifying glass icon on Windows 11’s taskbar.
2. Type **Remote Desktop Connection** within the search box.  
![A Remote Desktop Connection search](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/remote-desktop-connection-search.png)
3. Then click **Remote Desktop Connection** to open that accessory.
4. Alternatively, you can click its **Run as administrator** option within the search tool.

## 2\. Open Remote Desktop Connection With the Run Tool

 The Run tool is, as its title implies, a way to launch apps and programs. You can open Windows 11’s accessories and Control Panel applets just by entering Run commands. Here is how you can open Remote Desktop Connection with Run:

2. Select **Run** on that menu.
3. Type **mstsc** in the **Open** box.

`mtsc`
5. Press **Enter** to open Remote Desktop Connection.

## 4\. Open Remote Desktop Connection Within Its Folder

 Remote Desktop Connection is included within the Windows Accessories folder. You can open the accessory from its Windows Accessories folder in File Explorer. To do that, follow the steps below.

3. Click Remote Desktop Connection in that folder.

1. Bring up Windows 11’s Explorer folder and file manager tool.
2. Click inside Explorer’s address bar and erase the current path in it.
3. Input **mstsc.exe** inside File Explorer’s empty address bar.

4. Press **Enter** to open Remote Desktop Connection.

## 7\. Open Remote Desktop Connection With Task Manager

 Task Manager is a utility with which you can both terminate and run processes. This is how you can open Remote Desktop Connection by running its process with Task Manager’s Create new task tool:

1. Activate Task Manager by utilizing the **Ctrl** \+ **Shift** \+ **Esc** hotkey to access that system utility.
2. Click **File** at the top of Task Manager to view a small window.

3. Select the checkbox labeled **Create this task with administrative privileges**.

5. Select **OK** to run the Remote Desktop Connection process.

## 8\. Open Remote Desktop Connection With a Desktop Shortcut

 Desktop shortcuts provide the most direct way to open software and accessories. You can set up a shortcut for RDC so you can open it directly from your desktop. This is how you can set up a Remote Desktop Connection shortcut in Windows 11\.

1. Right-click an area of your desktop wallpaper to select **New** \> **Shortcut**.
2. Input **%windir%\\system32\\mstsc.exe** in the Create Shortcut window, and click **Next** to continue.  
![The Create Shortcut window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/create-shortcut-window.png)
3. Type **Remote Desktop Connection** in the text box.
4. Press the **Finish** button to add the shortcut to the desktop as in the screenshot directly below.  
![A Remote Desktop Connection shortcut](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/remote-desktop-connection-shortcut.png)
5. Now you can click the new desktop shortcut to open Remote Desktop Connection.

 That shortcut will simply open the RDC window. You can also set up a Remote Desktop Connection shortcut for a specific PC. To do that, enter **mstsc.exe /v:PC-name** in the Create Shortcut window’s item location text box. Replace **PC-name** in that item location with the actual name of a PC to connect with.

 If you prefer, you can have a taskbar shortcut for Remote Desktop Connection instead. Right-click the Remote Desktop Connection shortcut and select **Show more options** \> **Pin to taskbar**. Selecting that option will add an RDC shortcut to the taskbar as shown in the snapshot below. You can remove the desktop one by right-clicking it and selecting **Delete**.

## 9\. Open Remote Desktop Connection With a Keyboard Shortcut

 You can add a hotkey to an RDC desktop shortcut. By doing so, you’ll be able to open Remote Desktop Connection with a keyboard shortcut. First, [set up a desktop shortcut](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-desktop-shortcut-how-work/) as outlined for method five. Then you can add a hotkey to that shortcut as follows.

1. Right-click the Remote Desktop Connection shortcut on the desktop and select **Properties**.
2. Click inside the **Shortcut** **key** box shown in the screenshot below.  
![The Shortcut key box](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/shortcut-key-box.png)
3. Press the **R** key to set up a **Ctrl + Alt + R** hotkey.
4. Click the **Apply** button to save the new keyboard shortcut.

 Now you can press **Ctrl + Alt + R** to bring up Remote Desktop Connection whenever you need it. However, don’t delete the desktop shortcut for it. That shortcut must remain in place for its hotkey to work.

## 10\. Open Remote Desktop Connection With the Context Menu

 The context menu is the right-click menu you can open from the desktop. That menu doesn’t include Remote Desktop Connection by default. However, you can add a shortcut for opening Remote Desktop Connection to the context menu with a relatively straightforward registry tweak as follows:

1. [Start the Registry Editor app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-registry-editor/) by pressing the **Windows** button + **R** keyboard shortcut, entering a **regedit** command inside the Run dialog, and clicking **OK**.
2. Click in the registry location bar and erase the path there.
3. Input this location for the shell key inside Registry Editor’s address bar and press **Enter**:  
`Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shell\`
4. Click the **shell** key with your mouse’s right button and select **New**.
5. Select **Key** to add a new registry entry.  
![The New > Key options](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/new-key-options3.jpg)
6. Input **Remote Desktop Connection** for the new key’s title.
7. Right-click **Remote Desktop Connection** to select **New** \> **Key** options.
8. Next, input **command** inside the text box for the new subkey.
9. Right-click the **(Default)** string inside the new command subkey and select **Modify**.  
![The Modify option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/the-modify-option.jpg)
10. Input **"C:\\Windows\\System32\\mstsc"** inside the **Value data** box and select **OK**.  
![The Edit String window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/edit-string-window.jpg)

 Now you can open the Remote Desktop Connection app from your desktop’s context menu. Right-click any empty area of the Windows 11 desktop to select **Show more options** for viewing the classic context menu. You’ll see a new **Remote Desktop Connection** shortcut on the classic context menu. Click that shortcut to access the Remote Desktop Connection app.

 You can remove the **Remote Desktop Connection** context menu shortcut any time you wish. To do so, return to the shell registry location specified in step three above. Right-click the **Remote Desktop Connection** key you added and select **Delete** \> **Yes**.
