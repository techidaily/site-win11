## Trick to Invoke Admin-Level PowerShell on Your Win11 PC

 PowerShell is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language built on .NET technology. It's designed especially for system administrators and power users, so it has more features than the standard Command Prompt. If you want to use PowerShell to do anything more than basic tasks, you must run it as an administrator.

 In this guide, we'll show you ten simple ways to open an elevated PowerShell prompt on Windows 11.

## 1\. How to Open Windows PowerShell as an Administrator Using the Power User Menu

1. Right-click on**Start** to open the quick access menu. You can also access it by pressing**Win + X** on your keyboard.
2. From the menu list, select**Terminal (Admin)** .
