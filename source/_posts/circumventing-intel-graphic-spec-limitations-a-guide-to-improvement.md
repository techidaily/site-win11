5. Next, click **Browse**.

1. Navigate to the location where the Intel setup file is stored. Open the folder and select the file **autorun.inf** and click **Open**.

3. Click **OK** to proceed.
4. In the next screen, you can select your Intel graphics model. If you don’t know the model number, select **Intel HD Graphics** and click **Next**. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
5. Once installed, restart your PC.

 In most instances, manually selecting the installation file will install the Intel graphics driver without error. However, if the error persists, you can [roll back or update the driver from the Device Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-10/) to fix the problem. In Device Manager, expand the **Display Adapters** section and select **Intel HD graphics** to perform a rollback.

 If a rollback is not available, check your computer for new Windows updates. On Windows 11, press **Win + I** to open **Setting**s and then the **Windows Update** tab. Then click on **Check for updates**. Install any updates available for the display adapter. Once installed, restart your computer to apply the changes and check for any improvements.
