## Breeze Through Tasks: Custom Windows Shortcuts for UWP

 Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps are those you download from the Microsoft Store. Unlike desktop software, you don’t need to install UWP apps with setup files. The UWP apps you download automatically get installed to a default WindowsApps restricted location.

 The usual way to create shortcuts for desktop apps is to right-click their EXE files within installation directories and select**Send to Desktop** . So, some users may wonder how they can create desktop shortcuts for UWP apps that are in an inaccessible WindowsApps folder. You can still create shortcuts for UWP apps with the methods below.

## 1\. Drag and Drop UWP Apps From the Start Menu Onto the Desktop

 A simple way to create shortcuts for UWP apps is to drag and drop them from the Start menu onto the desktop. To do that, open the Start menu and click**All apps** . Then click a UWP app on the menu, hold the left mouse button, and drag its icon onto the desktop. Release the left mouse button when you see a**Link** box to add the desktop shortcut.

## 3\. Create Desktop Shortcuts for Pre-Installed UWP Apps With the Create Shortcut Wizard

 The pre-installed UWP apps have Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) addresses with which you can open them. For example, inputting**ms-clock:** in Run will open the Alarms and Clock app. You can add pre-installed UWPs to the desktop by creating shortcuts with their URIs as follows:

1. Right-click any part of the desktop area within Windows 11 and move the cursor over the**New** submenu.
2. Click**Shortcut** to view the Create Shortcut wizard.
3. Input the URI for the UWP app in the location text box. For example, you would need to enter the**ms-clock:** URI there to create a desktop shortcut for Alarms & Clocks.  
![The ms-clock: URI in the Create Shortcut window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/create-shortcut-window.jpg)
4. Click**Next** to proceed to the final step of the wizard.
5. Enter the app’s name in the text box.
6. Press**Finish** to create your UWP app shortcut.  
![The Alarms and Clocks desktop app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/alarms-and-clocks-desktop-shortcut.jpg)

 This method will add a URL (web document) shortcut for opening the app to the desktop. These are some of the URIs with which you can create UWP desktop shortcuts:

* Microsoft Store:**ms-windows-store:**
* Camera:**microsoft.windows.camera:**
* Calendar:**outlookcal:**
* Photos:**ms-photos:**
* Weather:**bingweather:**

* Xbox:**xbox:**
* Windows Security:**windowsdefender:**
* Calculator:**calculator:**
* Microsoft News:**bingnews:**
* Snip and Sketch:**ms-screensketch:**

* Feedback Hub:**feedback-hub:**
* Settings:**ms-settings:**
* Tips:**ms-get-started:**
* Media Player:**mswindowsmusic:**
* Get Help:**ms-contact-support:**

 Incidentally, you can also create shortcuts with URIs for Settings pages much the same. Check out this [how to set up Settings page shortcuts](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-shortcuts-for-settings-pages/) guide for further details.

## 4\. Pin UWP Desktop Shortcuts to the Taskbar

 You can select to pin UWP apps to the taskbar with their desktop shortcuts. To do so, right-click the UWP app’s desktop shortcut and select**Show more options** \>**Pin to taskbar** . Then you can open the app from the taskbar instead.
