## What Is a Windows Product Key?

 A [Windows product key](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-product-keys-guide/) is a 25-character code you use to activate your copy of Windows. Since Windows 11 and 10 use a digital license method for activation, you don’t need to manually enter the key each time you upgrade or [clean install Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/important-things-remember-clean-installing-windows/).

 However, if you significantly change your device's hardware, Windows won't be able to detect the license tied to your device. A manual activation may also be necessary if you run into a Windows 11 activation error.

 To activate Windows in these cases, you'll need to enter the 25-character product key. As such, if you don't know your product key, we'll explain how to extract it from your Windows 11 or 10 system.

 Note that each edition of Windows uses its own unique product key. For example, if you have a license for the Windows 11/10 Home edition, you cannot use it to activate Windows Pro or other editions.

3. Click the **Save** button to save the product details in a text file.

 Also, you can use ShowKeyPlus to check your specific Windows edition using the product key and retrieve a key from a backup.

## 4\. Check Your Purchase Receipt or Email

 If you bought a Windows license key from an online retailer like Amazon, you likely received the info via email. Use keywords like "Windows license", "Windows product", and "Windows activation" to search for the confirmation mail that you received. Or check the **Orders** section of your account with that online retailer to find information on how to retrieve the key, or how the key was initially delivered.

 As another option, look for physical stickers on your computer with information related to your computer hardware and software configuration. These may also include the Windows product key or other necessary details to help you locate it.

## 5\. Contact Microsoft Support

 If all else fails, try contacting Microsoft support for assistance. You can ask for a callback using the **Get Help** app on your computer:
