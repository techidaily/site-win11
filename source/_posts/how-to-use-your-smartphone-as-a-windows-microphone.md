## How to Use Your Smartphone as a Windows Microphone

 Whether you're chatting with friends over Discord, participating in a family Zoom call, or laying down some tunes, a microphone can come in very handy for your computer. But what if you don't have one?

 While you may not have a microphone for your computer, the chances are that you have a smartphone. There's the solution to your problem: you can use your smartphone as a PC microphone, and it's easy to set up.

 We'll show you different ways to use your phone as a microphone. The instructions herein work for both Windows 10 and Windows 11\.

## How to Use Your Phone as a Microphone for PC

 One of the best ways to achieve this is by using [WO Mic](https://wolicheng.com/womic/). With this program, you can use USB, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi to connect your smartphone's microphone to your computer.

 It's entirely free to use, has low latency, and will work in any application just like a standard microphone. It's available for Windows 10/11 and Linux.

 Head over to the [WO Mic website](https://wolicheng.com/womic/) and download the PC client. The necessary drivers come part of this package. Then grab either the [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU36696/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wo.voice2) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1260978417) app.

 Launch the PC program (if you get a missing DLL error, install the [VC runtime redistributable from Microsoft](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc%5Fredist.x86.exe)). Go to **Connection > Connect** and choose a **Transport type**.

![connect wo mic](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/connect-wo-mic.jpg)

 We'll detail the steps for all the different options below.

### 1\. Connect via Bluetooth

 First, enable Bluetooth on your computer:

1. Press **Windows Key + I** to open Settings.
2. On Windows 10, go to **Devices > Bluetooth & other devices**. On Windows 11, go to **Bluetooth & devices**.
3. Slide **Bluetooth** to **On**. Your computer will now be discoverable to other devices.

![windows 11 bluetooth and devices](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/windows-11-bluetooth-and-devices.jpg)

 Next, enable Bluetooth on your phone. This option's exact location will vary per device, but it'll be somewhere in **Settings** (then perhaps within a **Connections** menu).

 Pair your phone with your computer. A notification should pop up on your computer to confirm the connection.

 On the desktop WO Mic program:

1. Beneath **Transport type**, select **Bluetooth**.
2. Select your phone from the **Target Bluetooth device** dropdown.
3. Click **Connect**.

 On the mobile WO Mic app:

1. Tap the **settings cog**.
2. Tap **Transport** and select **Bluetooth**.
3. Go back to the previous screen and tap the **play icon** to begin transmitting your voice.

### 2\. Connect via USB

 Connecting via USB is the best option for most people because it's more stable than a wireless connection and the latency is lower. This method only works for Android.

 To begin, connect your phone to your computer using a USB cable. Windows may prompt you to install a driver, so follow that process through if so.

 Next, [enable USB debugging in the Developer Options of your phone](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-usb-debugging-mode-on-android-makeuseof-explains/). Windows should then recognize your phone as a device.

 On the desktop WO Mic program:

1. Beneath **Transport type**, select **USB**.
2. Click **Connect**.

 On the mobile WO Mic app:

1. Tap the **settings cog**.
2. Tap **Transport** and select **USB**.
3. Go back to the previous screen and tap the **play icon** to activate your phone's microphone.

![wo mic android app settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/wo-mic-android-app-settings.jpg)

![wo mic android app main screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/wo-mic-android-app-main-screen.jpg)

Close

### 3\. Connect via Wi-Fi

 For this method, both your phone and computer need to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

 To set your Wi-Fi network on Windows:

1. Press **Windows key + I** to open Settings.
2. Go **Network & internet** \> **WiFi**.
3. Click **Show available networks**.
4. Click the one you wish to use, then click **Connect**.

![windows 11 available wifi networks](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/windows-11-available-wifi-networks.jpg)

 On the mobile WO Mic app:

1. Tap the **settings cog**.
2. Tap **Transport** and select **Wi-Fi**.
3. Go back to the previous screen and tap the **play icon**. A gray banner message should appear at the top with a number at the end. This is the IP address.

 On the desktop WO Mic program:

1. As your **Transport type**, select **Wi-Fi**.
2. In the **Phone IP address** field, input the IP address from the app.
3. Click **Connect** to begin using the microphone.

### 4\. Connect via Wi-Fi Direct

 This method requires you to [turn your phone into a Wi-Fi hotspot](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-a-hotspot-and-how-does-it-work/) and use your network data. Use this as a last resort if your computer doesn't have its own internet connection and the other methods above aren't suitable.

 First, create a mobile hotspot from your phone. The way to do this will vary per device, but have a look in **Settings** and you can find it usually beneath a **Connections** or **Tethering** category.

 Next, you need to link your computer to this hotspot:

1. Press **Windows Key + I** to open Settings.
2. Go to **Network & internet > WiFi**.
3. Click **Show available networks**.
4. Click the hotspot, then click **Connect**.

 On the mobile WO mic app:

1. Tap the **settings cog**.
2. Tap **Transport** and select **Wi-Fi Direct**.
3. Go back to the previous screen and tap the **play icon**.

 On the Windows WO Mic program:

1. As your **Transport type**, select **Wi-Fi Direct**.
2. Leave the **Soft AP IP address** field at its default.
3. Click **Connect**.

## Is Windows Not Detecting Your Voice?

 You shouldn't run into any problems, but if you follow the above instructions and [Windows isn't detecting the microphone](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-microphone-problems-windows-10/), there's an easy fix:

1. Press **Windows key + I** to open Settings.
2. Go to **System** \> **Sound**.
3. Beneath **Input**, select **Microphone (WO Mic Device)**.

![windows 11 sound input settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/windows-11-sound-input-settings.jpg)

 To check the microphone is detecting your voice:

* On Windows 10, speak into your smartphone and you should see the volume reflected on the **Test your microphone** bar.
* On Windows 11, click the **arrow** next to WO Mic Device to see its properties. From here, next to **Test your microphone**, click **Start test** and speak into your smartphone.

![windows 11 microphone settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/windows-11-microphone-settings.png)

## Alternative Methods to WO Mic

 There are alternatives to WO Mic, like [Megaphone Free](https://apps.apple.com/app/megaphone-free/id304955183) for iOS or [Microphone](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU36696/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grace.microphone) for Android, but these require the use of an audio connection jack:

 Download these apps, hook your phone to your Windows computer using a male-to-male headphone jack, and your phone will then function as a computer microphone.

 You can even plug in a pair of headphones to your computer's microphone jack and use them. It might seem like an odd idea, but both make use of vibrations for different primary functions.

 Simply put, headphones vibrate to create sound, while microphones monitor for vibrations. But you can still switch it and use the headphones as a microphone. However, bear in mind that the audio quality will leave a lot to be desired, making this a last resort option.

## Use Your Smartphone as a Webcam

 While using your smartphone as a Windows microphone might not be ideal for everyone, it's a perfect solution for those who need to get talking quickly and don't have a traditional microphone handy.

 When you can get yourself chatting within minutes without spending a cent, it's hard to complain. You're being cost-effective and utilizing the devices you already have—you can even use your smartphone as a webcam!

 While you may not have a microphone for your computer, the chances are that you have a smartphone. There's the solution to your problem: you can use your smartphone as a PC microphone, and it's easy to set up.

 We'll show you different ways to use your phone as a microphone. The instructions herein work for both Windows 10 and Windows 11\.
