## Guide to Activate Black Background on WinCalc

 Dark Mode is a special screen setting design that changes the color scheme to display dark themes instead of light ones. It can be used to reduce eye strain and make the overall experience more pleasant while using an app.

 The Windows Calculator App is one such application that allows users to switch between light and dark modes according to their preferences. This tutorial explains how to enable Dark Mode in the Windows Calculator App.

## How to Enable Dark Mode in Windows Calculator App

 There are two ways to enable Dark Mode in the Windows Calculator App. The first method involves using the Calculator Settings, while the second uses Personalization Settings. Let's see each of them in detail:
