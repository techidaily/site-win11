## What Is the Windows Registry?

 The Windows Registry stores the necessary configuration settings which a Windows system component or a program needs to run properly. Tweaking enthusiasts can tinker with registry entries and even create new ones to modify the behavior of a program. You can[activate hidden Windows 11 themes](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-secret-themes-registry/) by altering the registry values.

 It may sound exciting to tweak the Windows Registry and unlock new features. However, you must never change, add, or delete any entries in it unless instructed to do so by a trusted source. If you're not careful with how you edit the Registry, you can do serious harm to your PC.

 However, the Windows Registry isn’t impervious to errors. These errors can arise due to malware infestations, unexpected power failures, and corrupt or outdated entries.
