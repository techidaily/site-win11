![The Client for Microsoft Networks checkbox](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/client-for-microsoft-network-option.jpg)
6. Select**OK** to save the new property setting, and restart your computer.

## 6\. Reinstall the Network Adapter Driver

 Error 0x800704CF can occur because of a network adapter driver issue. If your PC’s network driver is faulty, reinstalling it could be the potential solution for you. Try reinstalling your PC’s network adapter driver like this:

2. Then right-click your PC’s internet network adapter to select an**Uninstall** **device** option for it.  
![The Uninstall device option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/properties-context-menu-option.jpg)
3. Select the**Delete the driver** (or**Attempt to remove the driver**) checkbox.

6. Select**Scan for hardware changes** on the menu to detect and reinstall the missing network driver.

## 7\. Reregister the Microsoft Store App

 Reregistering the Microsoft Store app will reset it to a default configuration, which is the closest thing to reinstalling that app (it doesn’t have an option for uninstalling).

 To apply this solution, open Command Prompt with admin rights, as outlined in steps one and two of resolution four in this guide. Then execute this command:

`Get-AppXPackage *Microsoft.WindowsStore* | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml&}`

## 8\. Reset Your PC’s Network

 Another potential cause of error 0x800704CF is misconfigured network settings. To address such a potential cause, you can reset your PC’s network components to default settings. Doing so also reinstalls network adapters.

![The Network Reset option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/network-reset-option.jpg)

 A network reset will erase saved connection details. So, make sure you’ve got your network password handy for re-establishing your connection. Our[how to reset your network settings on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/reset-network-settings-windows-11/) guide tells you how to apply this possible error 0x800704CF solution in Windows 11\. Fortunately, the steps for Windows 10 are the same.
