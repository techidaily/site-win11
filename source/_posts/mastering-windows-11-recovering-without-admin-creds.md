## Mastering Windows 11: Recovering without Admin Creds

 A factory reset can help you fix critical problems and improve your system performance.

But what if you have forgotten your administrator password or can't boot into your PC?

 For situations like this, Windows 11 offers a few alternative ways to factory reset your computer. You can factory reset Windows 11 without the admin password from the lock screen or by using a bootable Windows installation media. Let's explore the two ways you can bypass a Windows admin password and reset your PC.

![confirm Windows 11 pc reset 1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/confirm-Windows-11-pc-reset-1.png)

 If your computer can boot normally but can't log in, you can reset your Windows 11 computer from the login screen. To do this, you'll need to [boot into the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE)](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-boot-into-the-windows-recovery-environment/) to access Windows Advanced Startup Options. It consists of many troubleshooting tools, including the Reset this PC option that allows you to perform a reset without logging into your computer.

 Also, useful if you need to reinstall Windows 11 without deleting your personal files. This process will, however, remove your apps and settings.

 It is important to understand that you can [reset the forgotten Windows administrator password](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/3-ways-to-reset-the-forgotten-windows-administrator-password/) using a nifty Linux hack and other workarounds. Only proceed with the steps below if your end goal is to factory reset your computer and not reset the forgotten admin password.

 To factory reset Windows 11 without an admin password using the Windows Recovery Environment:

1. Turn on your PC and wait for the login screen to appear.In the bottom right corner, click on the **Power** options. It will show the **Restart** and **Shutdown** options. Don't click either just yet.  
![restart login screen windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/restart-login-screen-windows-11.png)
2. Press and hold the **Shift key** on your keyboard and click the **Restart** button. If required, click on **Restart Anyway** to force restart your PC. Release the **Shift** key when you see the "**please wait**" screen.
3. Your PC will now restart and enter the Windows Recovery Environment.
4. In the **Choose an option** screen, click on the **Troubleshoot** option.
5. In the Troubleshoot screen, click on **Reset this PC**.  
![reset this pc Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/reset-this-pc-Windows-11.png)
6. In the Reset this PC screen, you will be presented with two options. The **Keep my files** option will remove all the third-party apps and settings from your PC, but keep your personal files such as documents, media, etc. If you want to remove everything, then select **Remove everything.**
7. Next, you will be presented with two options again to reinstall Windows. If you select **Cloud Download**, Windows will first download the required operating system files and then perform a reinstall. In comparison, **Local Reinstall** will use the existing system files from the device to reinstall Windows.  
![reinstall windows cloud download local reinstall](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/reinsall-windows-cloud-download-local-reinstall.png)
8. To speed up the process, select **Local reinstall**. If that does not work, you can use the **Cloud download** option.  
![reinstalling Windows-11 after reset](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/reinstalling-Windows-11-after-reset.jpg)
9. In the **Are you ready to reset this device** screen, click on the **Reset** button to confirm the action and start the reset process.

 During the process, Windows will first reset your device to remove all the data, unless you have selected the **Keep my files** option, and then reinstall the operating system. It may take a while to complete the process, so leave your device idle and connected to the power outlet.

 If the reset process fails and requests additional system files, use the **Cloud download** option to perform a reset and try again. This often happens if your existing Windows installation is missing critical system files or corrupted.

![Windows 11 setup](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Windows-11-setup.png)

However, if that does not work, you can [clean install the Windows OS](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-11/) using a bootable USB drive. This is useful if you can't boot into Windows or the system image is damaged beyond repair.

2. Restart your PC and start pressing the **F8, F9** or **Esc** key to open the **Boot menu**. In the Boot menu, select your **USB flash drive** as the boot drive and press Enter.
