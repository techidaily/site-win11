6. In the Reset this PC screen, you will be presented with two options. The **Keep my files** option will remove all the third-party apps and settings from your PC, but keep your personal files such as documents, media, etc. If you want to remove everything, then select **Remove everything.**
7. Next, you will be presented with two options again to reinstall Windows.
