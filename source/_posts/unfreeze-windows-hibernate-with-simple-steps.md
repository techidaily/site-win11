## Unfreeze Windows Hibernate with Simple Steps

 Hibernate mode on Windows is a useful feature that allows you to save your session, power down your computer, and then resume your work exactly where you left off. However, there may be instances when your Windows PC fails to hibernate upon your command, resulting in your PC remaining powered on.

 If you face the same problem, don’t fret. Below, we’ve listed some effective solutions that will help fix the problem in no time.

## 1\. Run the Power Troubleshooter

 Running the built-in troubleshooters on Windows is the most effective way to fix common system-level issues. In this case, you can run the Power troubleshooter and see if that gets hibernate mode to work again. Here's how.

1. Press **Win + I** to open the Settings app.
2. Click on **Troubleshoot**.
3. Select **Other troubleshooters**.
4. Click the **Run** button next to **Power**.

 Allow the troubleshooter to scan your system for any issues and resolve them. Then, try using the hibernate option again and see if it works.

 Fast Startup is a useful feature that helps you [avoid slow boot times on your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-10-slow-boot-issues/).

1. Press **Win + R** to open Run.
2. Type **control** in the box and click **OK** to open the Control Panel.
3. Click on **Power Options**.
4. Click on **Choose what the power buttons do** from the left sidebar.
5. Click the **Change settings that are currently unavailable** link.
6. Select **Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
7. Uncheck the **Turn on fast startup (recommended)** option.
8. Click the **Save changes** button to apply the changes.

## 3\. Reset Your Power Plan

 If disabling fast startup doesn’t help, it's possible that there is a problem with your existing power plan settings. In that case, you can reset your power plan on Windows to its default settings and start afresh. To do so, use these steps:

1. Use one of the many [ways to run Command Prompt as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/).
2. Type the following command in the console and press **Enter**.  
`powercfg -restoredefaultschemes`

## 4\. Try Basic Fixes to Resolve Hibernation Problems on Windows

 If the above fixes prove ineffective, you can try some generic Windows fixes to resolve issues with hibernate mode.

* **Install Windows Updates:** Keeping your Windows PC updated to the most recent version allows you to benefit from the latest bug fixes and improvements.
