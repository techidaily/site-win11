## 1\. Restart the Printer

 Restarting the printer is a simple possible fix that’s worth a try. The printer could be stuck with a preceding request, which applying this solution might resolve. So, power off your printer for a few minutes and then turn it back on to see if that makes a difference.

## 2\. Deselect the "Allow Windows to Manage My Default Printer" Option

 The **Allow Windows to manage my default printer** option sets the most recently used printer to be the default one when enabled. This can cause issues if the printer with which you’re trying to print isn’t set as default. You can turn off that setting as follows:

1. Right-click the button for opening the Start menu to select **Search**.
2. Type **printers & scanners** inside the search utility.
3. Select **Printers & scanners** to open that Settings section.
4. Turn off the **Allow Windows to manage my default printer** setting by clicking that option’s toggle switch.

5. Then select your printer in Setting to click its **Set as default** button.

 You might see an alternative WS printer listed in Settings (most typically for Canon models). The WS stands for web services, and that printer shouldn’t be your default one. Make sure your standard printer is set as default.
