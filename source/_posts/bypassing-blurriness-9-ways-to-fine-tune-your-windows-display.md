 Device Manager isn't the best for finding new drivers, so if the above trick doesn't work out, check out[how to update AMD graphics cards](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-amd-graphics-card-drivers-windows/) or[how to update Nvidia graphics cards](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-update-nvidia-graphics-card-drivers-windows/) , depending on your GPU's model.

### 8\. Roll Back the Latest Windows Update

 If the blurry screen issue appears after a recent Windows update, you can try rolling back to the previous version. New updates can have bugs that wreck your system's performance.

Here’s how to roll back a recent Windows update:

1. Press**Win + R** to launch the Run command box.
2. Type**appwiz.cpl** and press the enter key to launch the**Programs and Features** utility.
3. Click on the**View installed updates** option.
4. Scroll down and locate the most recent update installation.
5. Then, click on the**Uninstall** button and follow the onscreen prompts to remove the update from your system.

### 9\. Use System Restore or Reset Your PC

 System Restore lets you roll back Windows to a previous state. If you encounter a screen blur issue after a recent program installation or update, you can use system restore to roll back to a state where things worked better. However, your system needs to have existing restore points saved to use this feature.

 If you don’t see any restore points available in the System Restore utility, then resetting Windows 11 is your last resort. Ensure that you back up all your data or use the in-place upgrade to keep all your files intact.

 You can check out how to do both of these in our guide on[how to factory reset Windows or use System Restore](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/system-restore-factory-reset-work-windows-10/) .

## A Blurry Windows 11 Blur Issue, Fixed

After that, override the High DPI settings and set the system for the best visual appearance. Lastly, update the GPU driver or perform a system restore to revert the system to a normal viewing experience.
