## Correcting Error Code: 0XA00F425D in Windows 1E11 Camera

 Windows' error 0xA00F425D is an issue users have reported occurs when trying to use their webcams with the Camera app. Users have said that error happens when clicking Camera’s Record button. That error message says, “Sorry, something went wrong… 0xA00F425D <VideoCaptureStartFailed> (0x80131500).”

 As a result, users can’t capture video with the Camera app. Error 0xA00F425D has mostly been reported to happen on Windows 10, but that app error can also arise in 11\. This is how to fix error 0xA00F425D in Windows 10 and 11 if you need to resolve this issue.

## 1\. Run the Camera and Recording Audio Troubleshooters

 Windows includes two troubleshooters that can feasibly resolve error 0xA00F425D. The camera troubleshooter specifically addresses webcam issues. Users who’ve fixed error 0xA00F425D have also found running the recording audio troubleshooter can resolve this issue.

This is how you can run those troubleshooters in Windows 10 and 11:

1. Bring up Settings, and select that app’s**System** tab.
2. Select the**Troubleshoot** \>**Other trouble-shooters** navigation options.  
![The Troubleshoot navigation option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/troubleshoot-option.jpg)
3. Click**Run** for the Camera troubleshooter.  
![The Run Camera troubleshooter option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/camera-troubleshooter.jpg)
4. Then click**Yes** in the**Get help** window to apply automated troubleshooting.  
![The Camera troubleshooting window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/camera-troubleshooter-window.jpg)
5. If the Camera troubleshooter doesn’t help much, try selecting**Run** for the Recording Audio troubleshooter.
6. Select your PC’s microphone device in the troubleshooter.

7. Press**Next** to apply the troubleshooting.

 Accessing troubleshooters in Windows 10 isn’t quite the same. Select**Update & Security** and Troubleshooter in Windows 10’s Settings app. Then click**Additional troubleshooter** to bring up the window from which you can open the tools. Note that Windows 10 also has an alternative**Speech** troubleshooter that can also resolve microphone issues.

## 2\. Enable Your PC’s Microphone

 Enabling the microphone is a confirmed solution for error 0xA00F425D. Running the Recording Audio troubleshooter might detect and enable a disabled microphone on your PC. However, you can manually enable your PC’s microphone as follows:

1. First, bring up**Device Manager** , which you can select to open from the Power User menu by pressing the**Windows** logo +**X** key combination.
2. Then double-click**Audio inputs and outputs** to view all devices associated with that category.  
![The Audio inputs and output category](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/audio-inputs-and-outputs.jpg)

![The Enable device option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/enable-device-option.jpg)
4. Press**Windows** logo +**I** to go into Settings, and select**Privacy** there.
5. Click**Microphone** to access settings for that device.
6. Turn on the**Microphone access** (or**Allow apps to access your Microphone**) option.  
![The Microphone access option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/microphone-access-option.jpg)
7. Then toggle on the**Camera** option to enable microphone access for that app.

## 3\. Plug an External Webcam Into an Alternative USB Port

 This potential error 0xA00F425D fix is for users who utilize external webcams with the Camera app. Some people have said they resolved error 0xA00F425D by plugging their external webcams into an alternative USB 2.0 port on their PCs. It's worth a try if you use an external camera for recording.

## 4\. Edit the Registry’s Platform Keys

 Users have also been able to get error 0xA00F425D fixed by editing two different Platform keys in the registry. This registry solution involves creating new EnableFrameServerMode DWORDs for those keys. You can apply that registry tweak within Windows 10 and 11 in the following steps:

1. Click the search box (or magnifying glass) on your taskbar.
2. Type**Registry Editor** inside your search box to find that app.
3. Click**Registry Editor** to open its window.
4. Then input this**Platform** key path into Registry Editor’s address bar and press**Enter** :  
`Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Media Foundation\Platform`
5. Right-click**Platform** in the left sidebar to select the**New** submenu.

1. Select**DWORD (32-bit) Value** option and input**EnableFrameServerMode** for the name.  
![The DWORD (32-bit) Value option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/dword-option.jpg)
2. Double-click the**EnableFrameServerMode** DWORD you’ve just added.
3. The**EnableFrameServerMode’s** value might be set to**0** by default. If it isn’t, however, input**0** in the data box to set that value.  
![The Edit DWORD window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/edit-dword-option.jpg)
4. Exit the Edit DWORD window by clicking**OK** .
5. Erase the current registry location in the address bar, and input the following alternative path there:  
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows Media Foundation\Platform`  
![A Platform key](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/enableframeserver-dword.jpg)
6. Repeat steps six to 10 for the second**Platform** key.

## 5\. Update Your Webcam’s Driver

 Another possible reason for error 0xA00F425D occurring is that your webcam’s driver is outmoded or faulty.

 After scanning your PC with Driver Booster or one of the alternatives, you’ll be able to select update driver options for the devices listed.
