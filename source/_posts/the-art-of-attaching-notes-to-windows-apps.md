## The Art of Attaching Notes to Windows Apps

 You can add notes to the Windows 11/10 desktop with Sticky Notes. However, you can't add any notes to software windows with that accessory. That's a pity since such a feature would enable you to stick all kinds of instructional and hotkey notes for apps to their windows, not to mention task reminders, etc.

 However, Stick A Note and Notezilla are two third-party apps with which you can stick notes to software windows, which we'll look at here.

## How to Add Sticky Notes to Software Windows With Stick a Note

 Stick A Note is a freeware and portable note-taking software for Windows 11 and Windows 10 from the talented solo developer Anand Gupta. By pressing that app's hotkey, you can add a note to any software window you wish. Follow these steps to get stuck in with Stick A Note:

1. First, open the [Stick A Note](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Office-tools/Diary-Organizers-Calendar/Stick-A-Note.shtml) Softpedia page.
2. Select Softpedia's**Download Now** and**Secure Download (US)** options.
3. [Bring up Windows 11's Explorer file manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) from the taskbar by clicking its folder library icon.
4. Navigate to the folder the Stick A Note ZIP file downloaded in.
5. Extract the downloaded**Stick A Note 3.0.1 (1).zip** archive. Our [how-to unzip files in Windows 10 guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/unzip-files-windows-10/) includes instructions for extracting ZIPs.

1. Double-click**Stick A Note.exe** in that software's extracted folder.
2. Next, double-click the**Stick A Note** system tray icon.
3. Click the**Settings** button on the app's window.  
![Stick a Note's Settings button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/stick-a-note-s-settings-button.jpg)
4. Select the**Shift** checkbox to change Stick A Note's hotkey to**Win** +**Shift** +**N** . This is necessary because Windows 11 already has a**Win** +**N** keyboard shortcut for notifications that matches this software's default hotkey.  
![The Note Hotkey option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/note-hotkey-option.jpg)
5. Click**OK** on the Settings â€“ Stick A Note window.

1. Open a software window to stick a note.
2. Press the**Win** +**Shift** +**N** hotkey to add a note to the window.
3. Click the sticky note and select**Edit Note** .
4. Enter the content in the**Note for this window** box.  
![The text box for adding notes with Stick a Note](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-edit-note-window.jpg)
5. Select**OK** in the Notes window.

 Now that note will remain stuck to the window until you delete it. If you close and reopen an app window, press the**Win** +**Shift** +**N** hotkey to view its note.

 Or you can set Stick A Note to automatically show notes after opening software windows. To do so, right-click the program's system tray icon and select**Settings** . Select the**Auto Show Note for the Active Program** checkbox, and click the**OK** option.

 To remove a note, click the**Edit** option in it; press the**Delete** button on the editing window. Select**Yes** on the dialogue box asks to confirm the note's deletion.

 Stick A Note is a little short on formatting options. For instance, you can't apply bold or italic formatting to a note's text. Nor are there any font selection or size options.

 However, you can at least change the color and size of the notes. To do that, right-click the**Stick a Note** system tray icon and select**Settings** \>**Note Settings** ; choose an alternative option on the**Note Color** drop-down menu. Enter values up to**600** in the size boxes to resize the notes.

## How to Stick Sticky Notes to Software Windows With Notezilla

 Notezilla is a more comprehensive sticky note app for Windows 11/10/8/7\. You can stick notes to the desktop area and software windows with Notezilla. This software also packs text-formatting options for notes, among other more advanced features.

 Alas, Notezilla isn't freeware software. It's retailing at a reasonable $29.95 on the Conceptworld site. You can try out Notezilla by downloading and installing its 30-day trial package. This is how you can stick notes to windows with Notezilla:

5. Click**OK** to stick the note to the selected window.

 Now move the software window around the desktop area. The attached note will move with the window it's stuck to. It will also still be there after closing and reopening the software you added it to.

 To erase an attached note, click it once and press the**Menu** button; select the**Delete note** option. Click**Yes** to confirm you want it erased.

 Notezilla also enables you to stick notes to specific files open in software packages. Bring up a word processor, spreadsheet, or any other application with which you can open document files. Open a file within the application. Stick a note to the software's window, as outlined for steps eight to 14 above. Select the checkbox for the file in the window and click**OK** . Then you'll only see the note in the software's window when you bring up the file you stuck it on.

![A sticky note for a file](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/a-sticky-note-for-a-file.jpg)

 Or you can stick a note to a webpage instead. Open a page in a web browser. Then drag the note onto the webpage, and select the**Stick to window** option. Select the checkbox for the page tab in the browser.

 To check out Notezilla's formatting options, double-click inside the note to add some content. Then right-click in the text box ao bring up a formatting context menu. There you can select different fonts and adjust the text size and color. Move your cursor over the**Font style** drop-down menu to select**Bold** ,**Italic** ,**Underline** , and**Strikethrough** options. You can even add images to your notes by clicking**Add picture** .
