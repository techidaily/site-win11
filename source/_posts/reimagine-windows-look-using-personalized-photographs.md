## How to Add a New Background or Picture to the Calendar App

 You can access the Calendar app from the Mail app. In the left pane of the Mail app, click on the**Calendar icon** , and the Calendar app will open in a new window on your PC.

 The Mail and Calendar apps are identical in terms of their**Personalization** settings. So you can use the same ways discussed above to set a background color or image to the Calendar app.

 However, the background image you choose will only appear in the left pane of the Calendar app—that too, with a blurred effect so that the text is legible on it.

 Moreover, when choosing a favorite picture as the left pane background, you will notice that the thumbnail of the custom picture you selected in the Mail app is already appearing as selected above the**Browse** button.

 So to make it appear on the left pane toggle on the**Fill entire window** option. Or hit**Browse** again to choose a new picture.
