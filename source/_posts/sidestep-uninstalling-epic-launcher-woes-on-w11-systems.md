## 1\. Close Epic Games Background Processes

 If you try to uninstall Epic Games Launcher, but Windows shows you the “Epic Games Launcher is currently running” message, there’s a background process stopping you. Even if you haven’t launched the app, its process might already run if it’s set to launch at system startup.

 However, you can easily stop the app from running in the background.

1. Right-click the **Start** button and select **Task Manager**.
2. Open the **Processes** tab.
3. Right-click **EpicGamesLauncher** and select **End Task**.

## 3\. Uninstall Epic Games Using Command Prompt

 There are [different ways to uninstall software in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/), and most people use Control Panel to remove software. However, it might not be the best choice especially when it comes to problematic apps. So, if the classical method didn’t work, it’s time to give Command Prompt a try.

1. [Launch Command Prompt with administrative rights](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/).
2. Type the **wmic** and press **Enter**.
3. Copy and run the **product where name="Epic Games Launcher" call uninstall** command line.
4. Confirm the action by typing **Y** and pressing **Enter**.

 Wait for Command Prompt to uninstall the app. If it displays the **Method executions successful** message, Epic Games Launcher is now uninstalled.

## 4\. Delete Epic Games From Registry

 If the Command Prompt method didn’t work, you should delete the Epic Games Launcher entries in the Registry Editor.

1. Launching Registry Editor with administrative rights.
2. In the Registry window, navigate to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE > SOFTWARE > Microsoft > Windows > CurrentVersion > Uninstall**. Windows shows installed programs using a combination of letters and numbers, so it might be difficult to identify which one corresponds to Epic Games Launcher.
3. Click each key one at a time and check the value displayed next to **Display Name**.
4. Once you find the right key, double-click **UninstallString** from the right pane and copy the **Value data** information.
5. To uninstall Epic Games Launcher, press **Windows key + R** to bring up a Run dialog. There, paste the Registry value and click **OK**.  
![Use the Registry Editor to uninstall Epic Games Launcher](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/uninstall-registry-1.jpg)

 Before editing the Registry, you should [manually create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) in case something goes wrong.

## 5\. Uninstall Epic Games in Safe Mode

 If Epic Games Launcher is still doing its best to stop you from uninstalling it, there’s a chance a background process is still interfering. In this case, you should [start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-boot-safe-mode/). By doing so, your system will start without any additional drivers and apps that might lead to conflict.
