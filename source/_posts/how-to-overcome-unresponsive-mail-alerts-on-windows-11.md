## How to Overcome Unresponsive Mail Alerts on Windows 11

 Are you getting the "System error can't get mail" error when accessing your emails through the Mail app? This error usually occurs when the Mail app doesn't have permission to access your email or when your system is showing an incorrect date and time.

 Fortunately, fixing the "System error can't get mail" error is a breeze. Simply apply the solutions below to troubleshoot the problem for good.

## 1\. Start With Some Quick and Simple Fixes

 Before making any significant changes to your computer, try logging out and back into the Mail app. This will eliminate any temporary bugs or glitches that may be causing the error.

### Log In and Out of Mail, Then Restart the App

 To log out of the Mail app, right-click on your account in the left sidebar and choose**Account settings.** Then, select the**Delete account** **from this device** option and click**Delete** in the following window.

### Allow Mail Through the Windows Firewall

 If the Mail app is blocked under the Windows Firewall settings, it will fail to fetch emails and show the "System error can't get mail" error. To fix this, you'll have to [allow the Mail app to run through the Windows Firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-allow-apps-windows-firewall/) .

### Update Windows

 The error can also appear due to an outdated Windows version. So, download any available Windows update to eliminate the problem at hand. To do that, open the**Settings app** (see how to [access Settings in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) ), choose**Windows Update** from the left sidebar, and then click on the**Check for updates** option in the right pane.
