## Sync Chrome and PC Time Seamlessly on Windows

 Have you encountered the "your clock is ahead/behind" error when visiting a webpage on Chrome? The error usually occurs when the date and time aren't set correctly on your device. Other possible causes include an incorrectly selected time zone or region, a bad CMOS battery, browsing an insecure website, and interference from the browser cache.

 If you are unable to access specific web pages or websites because of this error, here are a few fixes that may help.

## 1\. Ensure the Date and Time Are Correctly Configured

 Since the error message states that your PC has incorrect date and time settings, it is advisable first to check that these settings are correct. Look in the bottom-right corner of your screen and see what date and time your computer shows. If it's accurate and your device uses a 12-hour clock, make sure the correct period (AM or PM) is selected; it's an easy mistake to overlook.

 If the settings don't match the actual date and time, you should adjust them. If you're unfamiliar with the process, refer to our guide on [changing the date and time in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-change-date-time/). However, if the date and time are both correct but the error persists, it's time to try more complicated fixes.

## 2\. Perform Some Basic Chrome-Based Fixes

 If you fail to resolve the error by setting the date and time, try performing some basic Chrome fixes:

1. [Clear the cache and cookies in Chrome](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clear-cookies-cache-in-chrome/).
2. [Update Chrome to the latest version](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-chrome-firefox-edge-desktop-mobile/).
3. [Remove or turn off your Chrome extensions](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-clean-up-your-browser-extensions-the-easy-way/), especially those that interfere with the website's source code.
4. Uninstall Chrome and reinstall it.

 If this doesn't work, it's a sign that the problem lies outside of Chrome itself.

## 3\. Check How Widespread the Issue Is

 Analyze whether the issue persists on a single website or webpage or if it is consistent throughout your browser. To confirm this, visit other web pages of the same website or a different website to the one you get the error on, and see whether you also run into the same issue there.

 If you don't encounter the error elsewhere, the issue is likely specific to a particular website. That could be due to the expiration of the [SSL certificate](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ssl-certificate-need-one/) of the website, which is a security protocol that creates an encrypted connection between a web browser and a web server. Once it expires, the browser cannot verify the connection's security and displays the error.

 In contrast, if the error appears on every webpage or website you visit, the problem lies elsewhere.

## 4\. Change Your Time Zone

 If you're using your PC in a different timezone, either because you moved or you're on holiday, this can also result in Chrome displaying the "your clock is ahead/behind" error. Therefore, ensure the correct time zone is selected in Windows settings.

 To modify the time zone, refer to our guide on [changing the time zone settings in Windows 10](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-change-time-zone/). If you are running Windows 11, follow these steps to change the time zone:

1. Right-click on the clock in the bottom-right corner and click on **Adjust date and time**.  
![Open Adjust Date and Time Settings by Right-Clicking on the Clock](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-open-adjust-date-and-time-settings-by-right-clicking-on-the-clock.jpg)
2. Select the correct time zone from the settings next to **Time Zone**.
3. You can also turn on the toggle next to **Set time zone automatically** to adjust it automatically.

## 5\. Manually Sync the Time and Date

 Windows regularly syncs the time and date on your device with respect to the time server you've set. However, the operating system sometimes takes a few hours or even days to update, especially if you don't connect to the internet for a long time.

 If you have relocated since the last sync was made, you need to perform a manual sync. Follow these steps to do that:

1. Right-click on the time and date in the bottom-right corner and click **Adjust date and time**.
2. Click **Sync now** to sync the date and time manually.  
![Click on the Sync Now Button to Manually Sync the Date and Time in Windows Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/3-click-on-the-sync-now-button-to-manually-sync-the-date-and-time-in-windows-settings-app.jpg)

## 6\. Change the System Region

 The improper region configuration is also one of the common causes of the "your clock is ahead/behind" error, and correctly selecting the system region has resolved the error for many users. Therefore, you should ensure the correct region is selected in settings. To do that, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Settings app.
2. Navigate to the **Time & Language** tab on the left sidebar.
3. Open **Language and region** settings.  
![Go to Language and Region Settings in the Time and Language Tab of the Windows Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/4-go-to-language-and-region-settings-in-the-time-and-language-tab-of-the-windows-settings-app.jpg)
4. In the dropdown menu next to **Country or region**, select the region where you're located.  
![Select Your Region From the Region Dropdown Menu in the Windows Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5-select-your-region-from-the-region-dropdown-menu-in-the-windows-settings-app.jpg)

## 7\. Change the Internet Time Server Settings

 The internet time server keeps Windows' date and time settings accurate. If you have recently added a new time server or switched from the default one, that could affect your date and time configuration.

 You can ensure the default internet time server is selected by following these steps:

1. Right-click on the time and date in the bottom-right corner and click **Adjust date and time**.
2. Click the **Additional clocks** link under **Related Links**.  
![Open Additional Clocks Link Under Related Links in Date and Time Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/6-open-additional-clocks-link-under-related-links-in-date-and-time-settings-1.jpg)
3. Navigate to the **Internet Time** tab.
4. Click on the **Change settings** button.  
![Click on the Change Settings Button in the Internet Tab of the Date and Time Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/7-click-on-the-change-settings-button-in-the-internet-tab-of-the-date-and-time-settings.jpg)
5. Make sure **time.windows.com** is selected in the **Server** menu.
6. Also, ensure the box beside **Synchronize with an Internet time server** is checked. Then, click **OK**.  
![Select the Correct Server in the Internet Time Settings Window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/8-click-ok-after-ensuring-the-right-server-is-added-and-the-checkbox-beside-synchronize-with-an-internet-time-server-is-checked.jpg)
7. Finally, click **Apply** and then **OK**.

 If changing the time server settings does not resolve the issue, it's time to try something more advanced.

## 8\. Replace the Computer's CMOS Battery

 The [CMOS battery](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-a-cmos-battery-and-how-do-you-remove-one/) is a tiny battery installed on the motherboard of your device. Its job is to keep track of the date, time, and other settings, even when your computer is off. If the date and time settings seem to "change by themselves," your CMOS battery is likely faulty and needs to be replaced.

 However, [finding and replacing the CMOS battery](https://www.makeuseof.com/computer-battery-dead-how-fix-replace-cmos/) can be tricky if you don't have technical expertise. If you're unsure about performing this step take your device to a repair shop.
