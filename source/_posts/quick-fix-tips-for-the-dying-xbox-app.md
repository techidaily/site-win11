## 1\. Check Your Internet Connection

 A sketchy internet connection may prevent you from downloading or launching games from the Xbox app. Hence, before spending time on any advanced solutions,[run a quick internet speed test](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-websites-test-internet-speed/) on your PC to check your connection. You can also try switching to a different network connection if one is available.

## 2\. Correct Date and Time on Your PC

[Having your PC set to the wrong date or time](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/3-reasons-windows-computer-loses-time-date/) may not seem like a big deal, but it can lead to a slew of problems. In this case, it may block the Xbox app from communicating with the servers, thereby preventing you from using it. You can easily avoid such issues by configuring Windows to set the correct time automatically. Here are the steps you need to follow.

1. Press**Win + I** to launch the Settings app.
2. Select**Time & language** from the left pane.
3. Click on**Date and time** .
4. Enable the toggle next to**Set time automatically** .

Restart the Xbox app after this and see if it works fine.

## 4\. Reinstall the Gaming Services App

 The Gaming Services app on Windows facilitates the installation of games through the Windows Store. If the Gaming Services app is having problems, the Xbox app may redirect you to the Microsoft Store when you try to launch a game or display the error code 0x00000001.

 You can try reinstalling the Gaming Services app on Windows to see if that resolves the issue. Here's how you can go about it.

1. Press**Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type**Windows PowerShell** in the box and select**Run as administrator** .
3. Select**Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
4. In the console, paste the following command and press**Enter** to uninstall the Gaming Services app.  
`get-appxpackage Microsoft.GamingServices | remove-AppxPackage -allusers`
5. Run the following command to open the Gaming Services app page in Microsoft Store.  
`start ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=9MWPM2CQNLHN`  
![Reinstall Gaming Services App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Reinstall-Gaming-Services-App.jpg)
6. Click the**Install** button to download the app.

[Restart your PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/) after this and try to use the Xbox app again.

## 5\. Run the Windows Store Apps Troubleshooter

## 7\. Update the Xbox App

 If you haven't updated Xbox app in a while, you could encounter problems while using it. Plus, using an outdated version of the Xbox app also causes you to miss out on the latest features. Hence, it’s always a good idea to enable automatic app updates on Windows or learn[how to update Windows apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-apps-windows-11/) manually. Alternatively, you can update the Xbox app manually from the Microsoft Store.

 Launch Microsoft Store and use the search bar to locate the**Xbox** app. Click the**Update** button to install any pending updates for the Xbox app and then try to use it again.

 While you are at it, we’d also recommend you install any pending Windows updates. To do so, open the**Settings** app and head over to the**Windows Update** section. Click the**Check for updates** button and install any pending system updates on your computer. Following this, the Xbox app should work fine.
