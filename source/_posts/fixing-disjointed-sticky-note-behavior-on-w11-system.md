## Fixing Disjointed Sticky Note Behavior on W11 System

 Microsoft Sticky Notes has significantly improved with the newer versions of Windows OS. It has a better card-style layout, supports dark mode, and can sync with OneDrive so you never lose your notes.

 But some users face an issue with the app, and their notes do not automatically sync in Windows 11\. The potential reasons for this issue can be internet issues, misconfigured app settings, or a corrupt or outdated app version. Try these methods to make the Sticky Notes sync feature functional again.

## 1\. Try Some Preliminary Fixes

 Syncing the notes requires an active and uninterrupted internet connection to work properly. So, check if your PC can access the internet by launching a web-based app or opening a website in Chrome or any other web browser.

 If you face network inconsistencies, [restart your router the correct way](https://www.makeuseof.com/reboot-router-correct-way/) to clear its cache. Once it's back online, connect your PC to the router and check if the sync feature works properly.

## 2\. Terminate and Restart the Sticky Notes App

 Apps can suffer glitches from time to time, so try terminating the Sticky Notes app and relaunching it again. Repeat the following steps to do that:

1. Press **Win + I** to [open the Settings app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/).
2. Click on the **Apps** option from the right-hand side menu. After that, click on the **Installed apps** option.
3. Scroll down and locate the Sticky Notes app in the list. Click on the **three horizontal dots** button to open the context menu. Click on the **Advanced options**.
4. Navigate down and click the **Terminate** button to close the app.

5. Press **Win + S** to open Windows Search. Type Sticky Notes and press the **Enter** key to relaunch the app.

## 3\. Perform a Complete Shutdown

 Modern versions of Windows OS use [Fast Startup](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-windows-fast-startup-why-disable-it/) which hibernates kernel-level processes and aids the PC to boot up quickly. But if these processes glitch, you can face issues with apps and services.

 As such, you can try doing a complete shutdown to see if that fixes Sticky Notes. This is a little different than your usual shutdown procedure, as you'll be telling your PC to skip Fast Startup with a command.

 Repeat the following steps:

1. Press **Win + R** to [open the Run dialog box](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/). Type **cmd** in the text box and press the **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** keys at once.
2. The User Account Control window will launch. Click on the **Yes** button to open Command Prompt.
3. Now, type the following command and press the **Enter** key to execute it: **shutdown /s /f /t 0**

4. Your PC will take slightly longer than usual to shut down.
5. Power on your PC and log in. Check if the Sticky Notes app and its sync feature work properly or not.

 If the app now works fine, check out [what Fast Startup is and how to disable it](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-windows-fast-startup-why-disable-it/) so you can turn it off.
