## Convert Websites Into Functional Windows Applications

 A native desktop is preferable to visiting a web page frequently. However, not all web apps are available as standalone desktop apps. If you use a web service frequently, you can turn the websites into desktop apps on Windows.

 By default, Microsoft Edge features a built-in feature to install websites as apps on Windows. You can do something similar on Chrome as well. In addition, there are third-party tools to convert a website into a desktop app.

## Why Use a Web App as a Desktop App?

 Desktop apps are easier and faster to access than web apps that require you to use a web browser. You can also add these apps to the Start menu and taskbar for quicker access.

 These apps are also often free of all the clutter that web browsers bring, including bookmarks, menus, and more. Then there is a full-screen benefit that allows you to use all the real estate for a distraction-free experience.

## 1\. Install a Website as an App Using Microsoft Edge

 Microsoft Edge has a handy feature to turn a website into an app. This is by far the easiest way to install a website as an app on Windows.

To install a website and app using Microsoft Edge:

1. Launch**Microsoft Edge** and open the website or page that you want to add as a desktop app.
2. Click the**three-dots menu** in the top right corner.
3. Select**Apps** and select**Install this site as an App** .  
![install this site as an app chatgpt edge](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/install-this-site-as-an-app-chatgpt-edge.jpg)
4. In the**Install app** dialog, enter a name for the app. It is important to enter a custom name as Edge by default will use the web page name and not the website name.  
![install chatgpt app windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/install-chatgpt-app-windows.jpg)
5. To change the app icon, click the**Edit** button and select an icon from your local drive.
6. Click**Install** and wait for the app to be installed.

 Once installed, the app will auto-start with a few options to customize. The app will now run safely in its own window. You can launch it from the Start menu, Windows taskbar, or your desktop.

 In the**Allow this app to** section, select all the options you want to activate. For example, you can pin or unpin the app to the taskbar, Start, add it as a desktop shortcut, and enable auto-start on device login. Select all the options you want and click**Allow** .

 You can open the installed apps from the Start menu. Use the three-dots menu in the app's top right corner to access print, zoom, casting, and share options.

### Uninstall An App in Microsoft Edge

![edge manage web apps](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/edge-manage-web-apps.jpg)

 Go to**edge://apps** using your web browser to manage all the installed apps and permissions. Click the**three-dots menu** and select**Uninstall** to remove the app. You can also[remove the app from the settings page](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/) by going to**Settings > Apps > Installed Apps.**

## 2\. Install Websites as App Using Google Chrome

 Google Chrome features a Create a shortcut feature. It works similarly to Edge's Install this site as an app and lets you run apps in their own window. This is an OS-independent feature, as you can also[run web apps on macOS using the Chrome shortcuts](https://www.makeuseof.com/run-web-apps-macos-using-chrome-shortcuts/) .

To add a shortcut to a website as an app in Chrome:

1. Launch**Google Chrome** .
2. Click the**three-dots menu** in the top-right corner.  
![chatgpt create chrome shortcut](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chatgpt-create-chrome-shortcut.jpg)
3. Next, go to**More Tools** and select**Create a shortcut** .  
![chatgpt create chrome shortcut create](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chatgpt-create-chrome-shortcut-create.jpg)
4. In the**Create a shortcut** pop-up, type a name for the app. Again, if you leave it default, Chrome will use the default web page name for the app.

5. Next, select the**Open as window** option.
6. Finally, click**Create to create** the website shortcut as an app.

 Your new app will automatically start in a new window. You can launch the app from the Start menu, taskbar, and Windows search. Furthermore, open the three-dots menu within the app to access essential features such as zoom, print, and more.

## How to Assign an Icon to a Website App

 Both Chrome and Edge can fetch and assign an appropriate icon based on the website logo to the app. However, if the app icon is missing or you want to change it, you can do it from its properties.

To change the app icon:

1. Right-click on the app's shortcut and select**Properties** .
2. In the**Properties** dialog, open the**Shortcut** tab.  
![website app properties shortcut](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/website-app-properties-shortcut.jpg)
3. Click the**Change icon** button at the bottom.

![website-app-properties-shortcut-change-icon](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/website-app-properties-shortcut-change-icon.jpg)
4. Click**Browse** and select a custom icon from your local drive. To use an existing icon from Windows's library, paste the following path in the**Change icon** dialog and click**Browse** .  

C:\Windows\System32\imageres.dll
5. The**Imageres.dll** file consists of the default icons pack for Windows. Select an icon from the library and click**OK** .

## 3\. Turn Websites Into Desktop Apps With WebCatalog

 WebCataglog is a platform for desktop web apps. It comes with a library of web apps that you can install with a click. You can also create custom apps using the website URL.

 WebCatalog uses the Photon rendering engine based on the Chromium framework to run the apps. You can also organize your work and play apps into separate spaces and easily switch between multiple accounts for web services.

To install a website as an app using WebCatalog:

1. Go to the[WebCatalog page](https://webcatalog.io/en/) and download the installer.
2. Once installed, launch the app.  
![webcatalog windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/webcatalog-windows.jpg)
3. To install an app, search for its existing library. If an app doesn't exist, you create a custom app.

1. Next, click**Select Local Image** and select an icon for the app.
2. Select the**Add shadows and rounded corners** option.
3. Click**Install** .
4. WebCataglog will download the necessary files and create a web app. This may take some time, depending on your internet connection.
5. Open the**Installed Apps** tab to view your recently installed apps. You can also close the existing apps to run two instances of the same app for different accounts.

 In addition, you can customize the app theme, pin the window to the system tray and enable always on top to keep the app window on other apps.

 Conversely, WebCatalog takes more space than an Edge or Chrome app. Also, the free version lets you use ten apps with two sessions per app.

## Install Websites as Desktop Apps on Windows

 Microsoft Edge and Chrome make it easy to install websites as desktop apps on Windows. You can also add them to Start, taskbar, or create a shortcut for quicker access.

 That said, if you need to work with several web apps with multiple accounts and sessions, WebCatalog is a good choice. You can choose from the app's library or create your custom app and organize them into different spaces.
