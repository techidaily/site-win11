## How to Uninstall the Phone Link App in Windows 10 and 11

![PowerShell Console with Command to Uninstall Phone Link App in Windows 10](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/uninstall-phone-link-app-using-powershell-windows.jpg)

 If you don’t use the Phone Link app or if the yourphone.exe process continues to appear even after disabling background app permissions, you can uninstall the app completely from your Windows computer.

 Like many built-in apps, Windows doesn't offer the conventional uninstall option to remove Phone Link. Instead, you'll need to use Windows PowerShell to remove the app.

 To uninstall the Phone Link app:

1. Press the **Win** key and type **PowerShell**.
2. Next, right-click on **PowerShell** from the search results and select **Run as administrator**.
3. In the PowerShell window, type the following command and press Enter:  
`Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.YourPhone -AllUsers | Remove-AppxPackage`
4. Once the command is executed, it’ll remove the Phone Link app from your computer.

 You can re-install the Phone Link app from the Microsoft Store if you want to give the app another shot.

## Is YourPhone.exe a Virus or Trojan?

 Yourphone.exe or Phone Link is not a malicious process or virus but part of the Phone Link app on Windows. Don’t be alarmed if you notice the process in Task Manager. If you need to remove it, you can do so by limiting the background permission for the app or by uninstalling it from your computer.

## Managing the Phone Link Process in Windows 10 and 11

 The Phone Link (yourphone.exe) process is not a security risk; allowing it to run in the background is necessary for the app to render its services. Limiting its background permission may prevent it from connecting to your phone and showing up-to-date information. That said, if you don’t have a use for the app, you can delete it using PowerShell and save some storage space on your hard drive.
