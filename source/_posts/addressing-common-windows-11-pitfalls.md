## Addressing Common Windows 11 Pitfalls

 Microsoft released the 22H2 update in November 2022, and even though it brought several positive changes, some users are unhappy because of the issues it causes within their systems.

 So, let's look at the most common issues caused by this update and the solutions to fix them.

## 1\. Windows 11 22H2 Update Not Installing

 Many users are unable to install the Windows 11 22H2 update, and upon trying, they encounter different error codes that do not list the cause of the issue.

 This problem is typically caused when you do not have sufficient space in your device for the new update or when your device does not meet the hardware and software requirements for Windows 11.

 We have a detailed guide on the [fixes to try if you are unable to install the Windows 22H2 update](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-22h2-not-installing/) , which you can head over to. If basic troubleshooting does not do the trick, you can perform a clean installation of Windows using the ISO file, as if you're [installing Windows 11 on an old PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-install-on-old-pc/) . By doing this, your system will automatically update to the 22H2 version upon completing the process.

 We also recommend uninstalling your printer before upgrading to the Windows 11 22H2 version. Microsoft has confirmed that a faulty printer driver can cause the system to block the upgrade process.

Follow these steps to uninstall the printer:

1. Press the Win + I keys together to open Windows Settings.
2. Choose**Bluetooth & devices** from the left pane and click on**Printers & scanners** on the right side of the window.  
![Choose the Printers & scanners option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/printers-and-scanners.jpg)
3. In the following window, choose a printer and then click on the**Remove** button.

After the printer is uninstalled, try updating your system again.

## 2\. BSOD After Installing the Update

 After installing the update, you might also encounter a blue or black screen of death. Typically, these issues are caused by the outdated drivers on the system but can be caused by other reasons as well.

 In this case, the first course of action is to update the drivers via the Device Manager. In case you cannot access the system,[boot into Safe Mode via the Windows 11 Recovery Menu](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-boot-safe-mode/) .

Once you are in Safe Mode, follow these steps to update the drivers:

1. Type Device Manager in Windows Search and click**Open** .
2. In the following window, expand all the categories and look for any drivers with a yellow exclamation mark. This symbolizes that the driver is either corrupt or out of date.
3. Right-click on the driver and choose**Update driver** from the context menu.  
![Update driver option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/display-adapters-update-driver.jpg)
4. Now, click on**Search automatically for drivers** to let the utility search the system for an updated version.  
![Search automatically for drivers option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/display-adapter-search-automatically-for-drivers.jpg)
5. Then, follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 If a corrupt or outdated driver is not the cause of the problem, then you can [check the BSOD log files in the Event Viewer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-bsod-log-file-location/) to determine the cause of the problem and implement solutions accordingly.

## 3\. Networking Issues in the System

 Another common issue users reported is the Ethernet and Wi-Fi adapters. The easiest way to fix networking issues is by running the network troubleshooter or resetting the network settings.

Here is how you can run the Network troubleshooter:

1. Press the Win + I keys together to open Windows Settings.
2. Navigate to**System** \>**Troubleshoot** \>**Other troubleshooters** .  
![Click on Other troubleshooters](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/other-troubleshooters-win11.jpg)
3. Now, look for the Network Adapter troubleshooter and click on the**Run** button for it.  
![Run the network adapter troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/network-adapter-run.jpg)

</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. Wait for the troubleshooter to scan the system for errors, then check the result. In case the troubleshooter has identified errors, it will suggest fixes for them. Click on**Apply this fix** to proceed.
5. If not, click on the**Close the troubleshooter** button.

 If running the Network troubleshooter did not resolve the issue, you can proceed with [resetting the network settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/reset-network-settings-windows-11/) .

## 4\. Sound Not Working

 If the Windows 22H2 update affected your system sound, the first thing that you should do is run the Audio troubleshooter. Simply access the**Other troubleshooters** menu by following the steps described above and run the Audio troubleshooter from there.

 The KB5017321 and KB5017026 updates also cause this issue. If you have these updates installed on the system, uninstall them to resolve the problem.

Here is how you can do that:

1. Press Win + R to open a Run dialog box.
2. Type control in the text field of the dialog box and click Enter.
3. Now, click on**Uninstall a program** under the Programs section of the Control Panel.  
![Uninstall a program option in Control Panel](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/uninstall-a-program.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. Choose**View installed updates** from the left pane.  
![View installed updates option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/view-installed-updates.jpg)
5. Next, locate the targeted update and right-click on it.
6. Choose**Uninstall** from the context menu.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
7. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the uninstallation process and check if the issue is resolved.

## 5\. Slow System Performance

 In some cases, the 22H2 update can also slow down the system's performance. This can happen when the update files are corrupt or a background process interrupts the system's processes. In this case, we recommend disabling the background apps and checking if that fixes the problem.

Follow these steps to proceed:

1. Open the Settings app by pressing**Win + I** keys.
2. Head over to**Apps** \>**Apps and features** .
3. Scroll down to look for the targeted app, and then click on the three buttons associated with it.
4. Choose**Advanced options** from the context menu.  
![Access the Advanced options of the app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/advanced-options-app.jpg)
5. Navigate to the Background apps permissions section and choose**Never** .  
![Dont allow the app to run in the background](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/background-app-permission.jpg)

 Perform the same steps for the apps that you think might be causing the issue, and then check if doing so improves the system's overall speed. You can also check out the other [ways to make Windows faster and improve its performance](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-10-faster-performance/) .

## Upgrade to Windows 11 22H2 Version Successfully

 The tips and tricks mentioned above will help you successfully upgrade to the Windows 11 22H2 version. However, if you are using Windows 11 on incompatible hardware, then you might need to clean install Windows 11 directly from the ISO file to upgrade it since Microsoft has become more strict about the minimum installation requirements recently.

 If you feel that the 22H2 version is quite problematic as of now, then we recommend you wait for Microsoft to launch the official fixes. 'Til then, you can stay on the 21H2 version or roll back to Windows 10.
