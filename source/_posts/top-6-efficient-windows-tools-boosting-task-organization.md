## Top 6 Efficient Windows Tools Boosting Task Organization

 Could your computer help you get more work done? It certainly can, but only the most effective software will streamline your workflow and let you get to the task at hand.

 Used correctly, great organization software can make you more productive. It's a matter of working smarter rather than harder; if you can entrust a well-designed program with matters of scheduling or communication, it leaves you more time to get the actual work done.

 However, sub-par tools will yield sub-par results. It's important to be sure that the applications you're using are up to the job. Here are some of the best modern apps available to simplify your working life and allow you to concentrate on the important things.

## 1\. Calendar

 Microsoft's own attempt at a calendar app is very easy to use, as you can easily keep track of your daily tasks and update your entries. What it does have going for it is a sleek, clean interface that will be familiar to anyone who has experience with [modern Windows apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-free-windows-store-apps/), but that comes at the cost of features that advanced users will expect.

![Windows 11 calendar](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/windows-calendar-1.jpg)

 It's easy enough to sync your events if you're entrenched in the Windows product line, but if you're not then you'll have more difficulty. For example, a workaround does exist to export your Google Calendar events to the Microsoft app, but it's extra work for a tool that seems entirely focused on being user-friendly. The lack of a way to easily categorize and color-coordinate events also seems like a major omission.

 That said, if you only need the most basic calendar functions, this app will do the job. It seems that advanced features have been removed to streamline the overall experience, and that comes through in the finished product. Anyone could use this app quite happily, no matter their experience, and that's crucial for this kind of software.

## 2\. Mail

 Microsoft's own email app carves out its own niche alongside the ever-popular Outlook. It rids users of much of the chaff of a traditional email client and leaves them with something much closer to the simplified email apps you might find on mobile devices — as seems to be the trend with Microsoft's modern app offerings.

![Windows Mail on Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/windows-mail-1.jpg)

 The mileage you'll get out of this app depends on whether that philosophy resonates with you. Power users who have grown accustomed to feature-heavy clients will likely be put off — but it's perfect for someone who simply wants to read their emails and respond to them if necessary.

 The UI is the star here; it's completely distraction-free, and there are plenty of people who will be sold on that alone. However, that same uncluttered interface means that tools you might find essential aren't at hand when you need them, and that might just be enough to send you to another [free email client for your PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-of-the-best-desktop-email-clients-for-windows-that-dont-cost-a-dime/).

![Check your messages with All-in-One Messenger](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/all-messenger-1.jpg)

 There’s nothing more disruptive than constantly receiving message notifications on your phone and computer while working. Even if you manage to ignore them for a while, you’ll have to go check all your messaging apps to make sure you’re not missing any important messages. Not only this is time-consuming, but you can easily lose your focus while going through multiple apps’ inboxes.

 Now, Singlebox is here to save you and keep everything in one place. This time management software supports the most popular apps such as Instagram, Telegram, Slack, Facebook Messenger, Discord, Twitch, and Steam. And the list goes on as [All-inOne Messenger supports more than 50 messenger services](https://allinone.im/messenger).

 Also, the app allows you to add each service multiple times. You could use different WhatsApp or Slack accounts at once if you have a personal and business account.

![Change All-in-One Messenger settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/all-messenger-settings-1.jpg)

 Using the **Settings** menu, you can easily change the app’s appearance, control push notifications, or enable dark mode to give your eyes a break. Through desktop notifications, All-in-One Messenger lets you know how many messages you have to check.
