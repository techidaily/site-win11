 Once you restart your computer, Microsoft Defender Application Guard will be installed and ready to use. In case you want to uninstall the Application Guard, you can do so by using the same command prompt steps. Just make sure to run the following command instead:

3. Now press**Enter** on your keyboard to execute it.
4. When PowerShell asks you to restart your computer, type**Y** and hit Enter.

 Upon restarting the computer, you will have successfully installed Microsoft Defender Application Guard on your system. Now you can make sure that you are browsing in a secure and protected environment.
