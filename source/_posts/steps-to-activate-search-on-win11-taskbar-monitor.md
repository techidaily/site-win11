## How to Install the Task Manager Search Bar on Windows 11

 To enable the search box feature in your Task Manager, visit [ViVeTool's GitHub page](https://github.com/thebookisclosed/ViVe/releases/) and download ViVeTool-vx.x.x.zip. After downloading the zip file, extract its contents to your computer's **C:/ViVeTool** folder.

 Once done, [run the command prompt with administrator rights](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/). For this, [open the Run dialog box](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) and type **cmd**, then press **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** on your keyboard. If UAC asks you for permission, click **Yes**.

 When you're in the Command Prompt window, copy and paste the following command and press Enter:

C:\vivetool\vivetool /enable /id:39420424
