### Perform a System Restore

 A restore point saves a copy of your systemâ€™s working image. Depending on your System Protection settings, you can use the [existing restore point to restore the system](https://www.makeuseof.com/use-system-restore-windows/) and undo system changes caused by an update or the user.

 Start with the most recent restore point available. If the problem persists, check if you can undo the most recently installed Windows update. You can also [manually uninstall Windows updates](https://www.makeuseof.com/manually-uninstall-windows-10-updates/) from the Settings app.

### Check for System File Corruption

 Damaged or missing Windows system files can be a reason why some of your system apps are not working. To fix the issue, [run the System File Checker utility](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-built-in-repair-tools/) to perform a scan and then run the DISM command to repair or replace the damaged files.

### Check for Issues With the Storage Drive

 Some apps can stop working if the storage drive is corrupt and need repair. You can [use the built-in check disk utility on Windows to scan and repair your drive](https://www.makeuseof.com/sir-mini-how-to-run-chkdsk-in-windows-10/) for data corruption.

### Disable Windows Defender

 If your Event Viewer cannot load the log files, check if the action is blocked by Windows Defender. To determine the problem, [temporarily disable Windows Security](https://www.makeuseof.com/temporarily-disable-windows-security-windows-11/) on Windows 11 and then try to open the log files in Event Viewer.

### Check for Memory Leak Issues

 Issues with your system memory are another reason why the Event Viewer app is not working. Fortunately, Windows has a built-in [Memory Diagnostic tool to scan and detect issues with your system memory](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-memory-diagnostic-tool-guide/).

 Often issues with the system memory may be due to faulty hardware. However, it is recommended to run more tests using the Memory Diagnostic tool report to get more insights into the issue.

### Perform a Windows Installation Repair

 If all else fails, you may need to repair your Windows installation. This will fix critical issues with your Windows image and reinstall the operating system without deleting apps and other data.

 You can [reinstall Windows 11 without deleting apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-reinstall-without-deleting-apps/) using a Windows 11 ISO image. If you download the latest version of the ISO, the repair installation process will upgrade your Windows to the latest version available.

## The Windows Event Viewer, Back to Normal

 Event Viewer is a handy utility to troubleshoot your system for issues and keep a tab on all the system and application activities.

 If you still have no luck, consider using an Event Viewer alternative. Third-party event log analyzers offer better visualization and advanced features.

 Event Viewer can stop working due to issues with the Windows system files, system memory, glitchy Event Viewer services, and corrupt user accounts. Even some rudimentary issues with the recently installed updates can trigger the issue. Here are a few troubleshooting tips to help you fix the Event Viewer not working problem on Windows 11\.
