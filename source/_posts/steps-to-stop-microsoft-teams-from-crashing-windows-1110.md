## Steps to Stop Microsoft Teams From Crashing Windows 11/10

 Microsoft Teams is one of the many pre-installed apps in Windows 11\. Unfortunately, while it is an excellent business collaboration platform, it is plagued by the occasional crashing issues.

 If the Microsoft Teams app is crashing or keeps restarting on your PC, here is how to troubleshoot and fix the problem in Windows 11\.

 Note that Microsoft offers two versions (Home and Work) of the Teams app. Due to differences in versions, some fixes below may not apply to the Teams (Work or School) version and vice versa.

## 1\. End the Microsoft Teams Process in Task Manager

![end microsoft teams process](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/end-microsoft-teams-process.png)

 You can kill and restart the Microsoft Teams process in Task Manager to fix crashing issues due to a temporary glitch. Here's how to do it:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the **Run** dialog.
2. Type **taskmgr** and click **OK** to open the Task Manager.
3. In the **Process** tab, look for any tasks associated with **Microsoft Teams.**
4. Select the process and click **End task.**
5. Close Task Manager and launch the Microsoft Teams app. Check if the app works without crashing.

 If the problem persists, perform a restart. A quick restart will force end all the background processes and help resolve issues due to temporary glitches.

## 2\. Sign Out and Quit the Teams App

 An easy workaround for the Teams app crashing issue requires you to sign out and quit the app. Once done, you should be able to sign in and use the app without any issues.

 To sign out of Microsoft Teams:

1. Launch the Teams app on your PC.
2. Next, click on your **Profile** icon and select Sign Out in the top-right corner.  
![Microsoft teams sign out](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/microsoft-teams-sign-out.jpg)
3. On the **Teams (Work or School)** version, the **Sign Out** option is at the bottom of the context menu.
4. Once you log out, close the Teams' sign-in window that appears. This should exit the app.  
![quit teams app system tray](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/quit-teams-app-system-tray.jpg)
5. Next, open the **System Tray** and check if the Microsoft **Teams** icon exists. If yes, right-click on the **Teams** icon and select **Quit**.
6. Relaunch the app and sign in. Check for any improvements.

## 3\. Clear Microsoft Teams Cache

![delete microosft teams cache](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/delete-microosft-teams-cache.jpg)

 Clearing Microsoft Teams cache from the AppData folder can quickly fix the crashing problem. Clearing the cache will fix issues triggered due to corrupted app cache. For this to work, you must be using the Teams (School or Work) version of the app.

 To delete Microsoft Teams cache:

1. Make sure the Teams app is closed. Also, quit the app from the system tray.
2. Next, press **Win + R** to open the **Run** dialog.
3. Next, copy and paste the following path in the Run dialog and click **OK**:  
`%appdata%MicrosoftTeams`
4. In the **Teams** folder, press **Ctrl + A** to select all the files and folders inside the folder.
5. Next, right-click and select **Delete**, or press the **Del** key on your keyboard.
6. Close File Explorer and restart your PC. Now restart the Teams app and sign in with your credentials.

## 4\. Repair Microsoft Teams

 You can repair some Microsoft Store apps and programs in Windows 11 and the older version of OS. The repair feature tries to repair the installation, thus fixing any problems triggered due to file corruption.

 Note that this fix is not applicable to the Microsoft Teams (Work or School) version.

 To repair the Microsoft Teams app:

1. Press **Win + X** to open the **WinX menu.**
2. Click on **Settings** from the context menu.
3. Open the **Apps** tab in the left pane.

6. Scroll down to the **Reset** section and click on **Repair**. Windows will start repairing the app and show a checkmark after the repair is complete.
7. Close the **Settings** page and launch Microsoft Teams to see if the crashing problem is resolved.

## 5\. Reset the Microsoft Teams App

![reset microsoft teams](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/reset-microsoft-teams.png)

 Like other Windows apps, Microsoft Teams uses cache space to store temporary files to improve the load time and user experience. But when not used properly or corrupted, it can cause the app to malfunction.

 You can manually clear the app cache to resolve this problem. Here’s how to do it for Microsoft Teams.

 Note that this fix is not applicable to the Microsoft Teams (Work or School) version.run microsoft teams compatibility mode windows 7

8. Click **Apply** and **OK** to save the changes.

 With the new changes in place, launch Microsoft Teams to see if the crashing problem is resolved. If the issue persists, use a different Windows version in compatibility mode to see if that helps resolve the issue.

## 8\. Update the Display Adapter Driver

![update driver display adapter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/update-driver-display-adapter.png)

5. Select **Search automatically for drivers**. Windows will now look for the newer version of the drivers and install them automatically.

 If no update is found, go to [Intel's Drivers & Software page](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html). Open the **Graphics** section and download the latest version of the drivers available for your processor. Also, refer to our guide on how to [update graphics drivers in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/) to know the different ways you can install the latest GPU drivers for your computer.

![disable intel hd display adapter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/disable-intel-hd-display-adapter.png)

 To uninstall the graphics driver:

1. Press **Win + X** to open the **WinX** menu. Then, click on **Device Manager.**
2. In Device Manager, expand the **Display Adapters** section.
3. Right-click on the **Intel HD Graphics** device driver and select **Disable device.** Click **Yes** to confirm the action.
4. Next, right-click on the display adapter and select **Enable**.

## 10\. Reinstall Microsoft Teams

![uninstall Microsoft teams](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/uninstall-Microsoft-teams.png)

 To uninstall Microsoft Teams:

2. Locate the Microsoft Teams app and click the **three-dots menu** next to the app name.

5. Select your Windows version and click the **Download** button.
6. Run the download package and install the app.

## 11\. Run the System File Checker Tool

![run system file checker](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/run-system-file-checker.png)

 If Microsoft Teams fails to launch, you can run the System File Checker tool. It will scan the system for file corruption and restore the corrupted system files. This is helpful if the system-related issues are preventing the app from launching.

1. Press **Win + X** to open the **WinX menu**.
2. Click on **Windows Terminal (Admin).**
3. In the Terminal window, type the following command and press enter:  
`sfc /scannow`
4. Depending on your disk drive size, the process will take a while to complete. Once completed, it shows a summary of the errors found and fixed.
5. Restart your PC and launch the Microsoft Teams app to see if it works normally.
