## Steps to Stop Microsoft Teams From Crashing Windows 11/10

 Microsoft Teams is one of the many pre-installed apps in Windows 11\. Unfortunately, while it is an excellent business collaboration platform, it is plagued by the occasional crashing issues.

 If the Microsoft Teams app is crashing or keeps restarting on your PC, here is how to troubleshoot and fix the problem in Windows 11\.

 Note that Microsoft offers two versions (Home and Work) of the Teams app. Due to differences in versions, some fixes below may not apply to the Teams (Work or School) version and vice versa.

## 1\. End the Microsoft Teams Process in Task Manager

![end microsoft teams process](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/end-microsoft-teams-process.png)

 You can kill and restart the Microsoft Teams process in Task Manager to fix crashing issues due to a temporary glitch. Here's how to do it:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the **Run** dialog.
2. Type **taskmgr** and click **OK** to open the Task Manager.
3. In the **Process** tab, look for any tasks associated with **Microsoft Teams.**
4. Select the process and click **End task.**
5. Close Task Manager and launch the Microsoft Teams app. Check if the app works without crashing.

 If the problem persists, perform a restart. A quick restart will force end all the background processes and help resolve issues due to temporary glitches.

## 2\. Sign Out and Quit the Teams App

 An easy workaround for the Teams app crashing issue requires you to sign out and quit the app. Once done, you should be able to sign in and use the app without any issues.

 To sign out of Microsoft Teams:

1. Launch the Teams app on your PC.
2. Next, click on your **Profile** icon and select Sign Out in the top-right corner.  
![Microsoft teams sign out](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/microsoft-teams-sign-out.jpg)
3. On the **Teams (Work or School)** version, the **Sign Out** option is at the bottom of the context menu.
4. Once you log out, close the Teams' sign-in window that appears. This should exit the app.  
![quit teams app system tray](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/quit-teams-app-system-tray.jpg)
5. Next, open the **System Tray** and check if the Microsoft **Teams** icon exists. If yes, right-click on the **Teams** icon and select **Quit**.
6. Relaunch the app and sign in. Check for any improvements.

Open the **Graphics** section and download the latest version of the drivers available for your processor.

## 9\. Disable the Display Adapter Driver

![disable intel hd display adapter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/disable-intel-hd-display-adapter.png)

 If updating the display driver did not help, uninstall the graphics driver to see if that helps you resolve the error. When uninstalled, Windows will use the generic display driver, but it will help you determine the cause of the problem.

1. Press **Win + X** to open the **WinX** menu. Then, click on **Device Manager.**
2. In Device Manager, expand the **Display Adapters** section.
3. Right-click on the **Intel HD Graphics** device driver and select **Disable device.** Click **Yes** to confirm the action.
4. Next, right-click on the display adapter and select **Enable**.

## 10\. Reinstall Microsoft Teams

6. Run the download package and install the app.

## 11\. Run the System File Checker Tool

![run system file checker](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/run-system-file-checker.png)

1. Press **Win + X** to open the **WinX menu**.
2. Click on **Windows Terminal (Admin).**
3. In the Terminal window, type the following command and press enter:  
`sfc /scannow`

 If the Microsoft Teams app is crashing or keeps restarting on your PC, here is how to troubleshoot and fix the problem in Windows 11\.

 Note that Microsoft offers two versions (Home and Work) of the Teams app. Due to differences in versions, some fixes below may not apply to the Teams (Work or School) version and vice versa.
