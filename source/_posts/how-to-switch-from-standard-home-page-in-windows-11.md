## 2\. Use the Registry Editor to Remove the Home Page

 Can't access the Group Policy Editor on your Windows PC? You can also remove the Home tab from the Windows 11 Settings app by making a few changes to the registry files.

 As you may already know, registry files store critical settings for Windows and your apps. Making incorrect changes to the registry can lead to serious problems. Hence, it’s a good idea to [back up all the registry files](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) or [create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/use-system-restore-windows/) before proceeding. This will allow you to restore the Windows registry to its previous state if something goes wrong.

 To hide the Home tab from the Settings app using Registry Editor, follow these steps:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog.
2. Type **regedit** in the text box and press **Enter**.
3. Select **Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
4. Use the left pane to navigate to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE > SOFTWARE > Microsoft > Windows > CurrentVersion > Policies > Explorer**.
5. Right-click the **Explorer** key, click **New**, and select **String Value** from the submenu. Rename it to **SettingsPageVisibility**.
6. Double-click the **SettingsPageVisibility** value to edit it.
7. Type **hide:home** in the Value data field and click **OK**.
