## Mastering Site Trust on Windows 11

 Whenever you browse the Internet, your browser analyzes each website to ensure it's safe for your computer. However, there might be situations when you wish to access a website despite its security status. If you're wondering how to do this, we're here to assist!

 In this article, we will show how to add trusted sites on Windows 11, plus instructions for various browsers such as Google Chrome, Brave, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox.

## How to Add Trusted Sites Using Internet Options

 As the name suggests, the Internet Options window is the go-to option to configure all your internet-related settings. You can use it to [set up a VPN on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/setup-vpn-windows-10/), manage cookies, add trusted sites, and much more.

 To use it to add trusted sites to browsers, follow the below instructions:

1. Copy the website URL you want to add to the trusted list.
2. Press the **Windows** key to open the **Start Menu,** type **Internet Options** in the search bar, and press Enter.

## How to Add a Website to the Google Chrome Trusted List
