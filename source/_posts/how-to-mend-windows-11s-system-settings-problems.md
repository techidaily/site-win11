## How to Mend Windows 11'S System Settings Problems

 SystemSettings.exe is an essential Windows component that lets you configure important system settings. However, due to corrupt system files, outdated drivers, or malware infections, you can face the SystemSettings.exe system error.

 Fortunately, it's a very common issue in Windows 11 and can easily be resolved using the below fixes.

## 1\. Try Some Basic Windows Fixes

 The SystemSettings.exe system error often occurs on systems with outdated or corrupt graphics drivers. In such cases,[downloading the latest graphics driver update](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/) can resolve the issue.

 It's also important to ensure that you have [installed the latest Windows updates](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-manually/) . This will not only provide access to the latest features but will also eliminate any bugs or glitches that may be causing the error.

 Corruption in the important system files is another major reason behind the error at hand. You can quickly detect and eliminate corruption by [running an SFC scan](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/) . However, if the SFC scan was unable to solve the issue,[run a DISM scan](https://www.makeuseof.com/difference-between-chkdsk-sfc-and-dism-in-windows-10/) to resolve the error.

## 2\. Remove Viruses & Malware From Your Computer

 If you're experiencing multiple issues with your Windows PC besides the SystemSettings.exe system error, it's possible that your system has been infected with a virus or malware. To determine if that is the case, we recommend running a full system scan. Here's how to do it:

1. Press the**Windows** key to open the**Start Menu.**
2. Type**Windows Security** in the search bar and press Enter.
3. Choose**Virus & threat protection** from the left sidebar and**Scan options** from the right pane.
4. Select the**Full scan** bulletin and click the**Scan Now** button.

 Now, wait till the scanning process is complete. It can take up to one hour, so keep patience. Once done, check out how to [remove found threats from your Windows PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-defender-antivirus-found-a-threat/) .

## 3\. Temporarily Disable Your Antivirus

 Improperly configured security applications can sometimes interfere with the functioning of trusted applications, resulting in error messages or complete failure to work. To address this issue, disabling your system's security application is often a viable solution.

 To disable the Windows Security app, check our guide on [temporarily disabling the Windows Security app](https://www.makeuseof.com/temporarily-disable-windows-security-windows-11/) on Windows 11\. However, if you're using a third-party antivirus program, check its user manual to know about its disabling process.

## 4\. Create a New User Account

![Other users window in the Settings app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/other-users.jpg)

 Creating a new user account is another solution to fix the SystemSettings.exe system error. This approach is particularly helpful if the issue is being caused by corruption in your current account.

 So,[create a new user account](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-create-local-user-account-windows/) and check if it solves the problem. If the new account does not encounter the same error, it indicates that your old user account is corrupt, and you will need to transfer your data to the new one.

 Alternatively, you can permanently delete the old user profile and use the new one instead. However,[back up important files and folders](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-windows-files-folders/) before deleting the user account.
