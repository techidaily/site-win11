## The Most Impressive Windows 10 Sketch Software Lineup

 If you are a professional artist or just a beginner wanting to begin your manga series, there are so many digital drawing apps available that it's easy to become overwhelmed. As such, we have picked out some of the best drawing apps for Windows 10 so that you know exactly what you need.

 Let's see what each app offers and which one fits your needs the best.

## 1\. Krita

 Whether you are a professional artist or an amateur, Krita is the software to choose if you don't want to spend money on drawing tools. The program supports the value of flexibility in the creative process, which is why it provides a flexible interface and customizable panels that you can set to your liking.

 The official website is the only place where you can download the Krita app for free. Unfortunately, Krita is no longer a free download on Microsoft Store.

 The stabilization tool helps keep lines smooth without any bumps or shakes. And for a change of style in your sketching, you can import free brush packs from the Krita community and mix up the tools you have at your disposal. Who knows, you might even find textures and patterns that fit you perfectly.

**Download:** [Krita](https://krita.org/en/download/krita-desktop/) (Free, Paid)

 Paint 3D provides realistic textures and filters you can incorporate into your illustrations to give them soul. You can even turn your doodles into a 3D drawing by using the tools available in the app.

 Among Paint 3D's best features is its resizable canvas. It allows you to resize the existing window rather than open a new one. Lastly, because it is a built-in application in Windows, it is free of charge.

## 4\. GIMP

![GIMP Software Interface](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GIMP-Software-Interface.png)

 Photoshop and GIMP are pretty similar. Most of its features are best for editing, but you can also use it as your main drawing and illustration tool. GIMP enables you to create beautiful artwork with unlimited textures and brushes that can be customized to fit your preferences.

 Would you like to edit a picture? Maybe retouch it a little? GIMP offers various tools for image editing. Last but not least, you can easily enhance your artwork by adding third-party plugins to GIMP. GIMP is a free image editing software, which is a huge plus.

**Download:** [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) (Free)

## 5\. Sketchable

 Sketchable serves as a journal and illustration app in one. You can scribble a note or paint a masterpiece; just let your creativity flow. For artists to concentrate on their work without distractions, Sketchable has an intuitive user interface.

 You can plan your journal covers, font type, resolution, etc., in Sketchable. Using the Journal file format, you can export and share your journals with others easily. Furthermore, the tool allows creators to improvise brush stabilization tools and use symmetry.

 Sketchable is a free tool that you can download from the Windows Store for basic sketching. Nevertheless, each premium tool costs around $1.99\. Thus, if you are an avid illustrator, you can get the entire package for just $19.99\.

**Download:** [Sketchable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/sketchable/9wzdncrfjcjw) (Free, in-app purchases available)

## 6\. Paintstorm Studio

 Paintstorm Studio is a beginner-friendly drawing software with many brushes, canvas, and color wheels. The canvas is high resolution, with options for different dimensions, ranging from millimeters to inches.

 A wide range of tools in the Paintstorm Studio are designede for different types of artwork, such as contemporary artwork, a traditional portrait, or a comic book series.

 The software has a wide selection of brushes, a stabilizer tool, and a clean interface with custom panels for hassle-free illustration. Paintstorm Studio is one of the best drawing apps (and is therefore on our list); however, keep in mind that the Windows version often tends to 'freeze.'
