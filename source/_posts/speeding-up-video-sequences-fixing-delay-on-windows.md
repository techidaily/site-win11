## Speeding Up Video Sequences: Fixing Delay on Windows

 VLC is a popular media player app among Windows users, owing to its versatility, ease of use, and support for a wide range of file formats. However, like most apps, VLC can sometimes disappoint you with strange issues. One example is when it fails to play your videos smoothly and constantly lags.

 Fortunately, there’s no need to settle for a subpar experience as it is possible to fix this annoying issue. Here we show you seven easy ways for fixing video lag in the VLC media player for Windows.

## 1\. Check the File Format

 Although VLC media player supports nearly every popular video format available, it does not support them all. If the video you're attempting to play is in an unsupported format, you may experience lag.

 You can [visit VLC's official webpage](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/features.html) to check all the file formats it supports. If your video is in an unsupported format, you’ll have to convert it first. If you need help with that, check our guide on [how to convert videos for free](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-convert-video-files-free-winx-video-converter/) .

## 2\. Disable Hardware Acceleration

 The hardware acceleration feature in VLC uses your GPU to accelerate the decoding process and achieve a smoother video playback. Nevertheless, there are instances when this feature malfunctions, causing videos to stutter in the VLC media player.

 You can try disabling the hardware acceleration feature in VLC and see if that improves the situation. To do so, use the following steps:

1. Open VLC media player.
2. Click on**Tools** and select**Preferences** from the resulting menu.
3. Select the**Input / Codes** tab at the top.
4. Use the drop-down menu next to**Hardware-accelerated decoding** to select**Disable** .
5. Click on**Save** .

Restart the VLC app after this and see if the video plays smoothly.

## 3\. Change Power Plan to High Performance

 Enabling a strict power profile on your Windows computer can cause apps to run slowly. As a result, videos in the VLC media player may lag or stutter. To avoid such performance issues, you can change your computer’s power plan to High Performance mode and see if that helps. Here are the steps for the same.

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type**control** in the Open field and press**Enter** . This will [open the Control Panel window](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-control-panel/) .
3. Click the drop-down menu in the top right corner to change the view type to**Small icons** or**Large icons** .
4. Click on**Power Options** to open that applet.
5. Select**High performance** .  
![High Performance Power Plan in Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/high-performance-power-plan-in-windows.jpg)

 Can’t find the High Performance power plan in Power Options? Check our guide on [how to restore a missing High Performance power plan in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-high-performance-power-plan/) and follow the steps outlined there.

## 4\. Disable In-Loop Deblocking Filter

 Another thing you can do to fix video lag in VLC is to disable the loop filter for H.264 decoding. Here's how to do it.

1. In the VLC app, click the**Tools** menu at the top and select**Preferences** . Alternatively, you can press**Ctrl + P** to quickly open the VLC Preferences window.
2. Switch to the**Input / Codes** tab.
3. Click the drop-down menu next to**Skip H.264 in-loop deblocking filter** and select**All** .

## 5\. Change the Caching Value

 When you use VLC to stream a video from the web, it caches some of the content for faster playback. If you're experiencing video lag while streaming, you can try increasing the network and file cache sizes to fix the issue.

 To increase the network and file caching values in VLC, use these steps:

1. Launch the VLC media player on your PC.
2. Click the**Tools** menu at the top and select**Preferences** from the list.
3. Select the**All** option under the**Show settings** section.
4. Select**Input / Codecs** from the left pane column.
5. Under the**Advanced** section, increase the value in the**File caching (ms)** field.
6. Similarly, increase the value for the**Network caching (ms)** as well.
7. Click the**Save** button.

## 6\. Reset the VLC Preferences

 VLC allows you to customize a number of settings and preferences that affect its behavior. However, if some of these preferences in the VLC app are not configured correctly, it could cause it to misbehave on Windows. Instead of going through each of your preferences one by one, it's easier to reset them all and start over.

To reset your VLC media player preferences, use these steps:

1. Launch the VLC media player on your PC.
2. Click the**Tools** menu at the top and select**Preferences** from the list.
3. In the Interface tab, click the**Reset Preferences** button at the bottom.
4. Click**OK** when the **Are you sure you want to reset your VLC media player preferences** dialog appears.  
![Reset VLC Preferences](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/reset-vlc-preferences.jpg)

Restart the VLC media player and check if the videos still lag.

## 7\. Update or Reinstall VLC Media Player

 App updates are critical for any app, and VLC is no exception. If the video playback issues in the VLC media player are caused by a bug, installing newer updates should help.

To check for pending updates in the VLC media player:

1. Open the VLC media player on Windows.
2. Click the**Help** menu at the top and select**Check for Updates** .  
![Check for Updates in VLC](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/check-for-updates-in-vlc.jpg)

 If an update is available, follow the on-screen prompts to install it. After that, videos should play smoothly on Windows.

 If updating the VLC media player doesn't help, it's possible that some of its core app files are corrupt. In that case, you can consider uninstalling and reinstalling the VLC media player as a last resort. For that, use the following steps:

1. Open the**Start menu** and click the**gear-shaped icon** to [launch the Settings app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) .
2. Navigate to the**Apps** tab using the left sidebar.
3. Click on**Installed apps** .
4. Scroll through the list or use the search bar at the top to quickly locate**VLC media player** on the list. Click the**three-dot menu icon** next to it and select**Uninstall** .
5. Select**Uninstall** once again to confirm.  
![Uninstall VLC Media Player on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/uninstall-vlc-media-player-on-windows.jpg)

 Once removed, open Microsoft Store on your PC and search for the VLC app. Then, click the**Install** button to download the app.

## Enjoy Smooth Video Playback in VLC for Windows Again
