## 1\. Restart the Computer

 The first thing you should do is restart your computer. It will help clean out any temporary bugs and hopefully get things back to normal.

 People are used to clicking the Start button, then restarting via the Power menu. However, if you can't click on anything, you'll need to use one of the other[ways to restart your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/) that doesn't rely on a functioning mouse to perform.

 After your computer restarts, check to see if the issue has been resolved.

## 2\. Check Your Mouse for Loose Connections or Dirt

 If restarting the computer didn’t work, then you should check your mouse. Make sure it is plugged in properly and that all the cables are securely connected.

 You can also try cleaning the components with compressed air or a damp cloth, as dust and debris can sometimes interfere. If that doesn't work, you may want to use a different mouse to see if the issue is with your hardware or not.

## 3\. Restart Explorer.exe via the Task Manager
