## Understanding & Correcting Windows Error: 0Xc00000f

 So you've just booted up your PC like any other day, but instead of seeing your home screen or desktop as usual, you instead have an error code 0xc000000f in front of you. While getting hit by errors like these out of the blue can be confusing, you don't have to panic.

 The Windows error code 0xc000000f is a booting error faced occasionally by Windows users. Luckily, you have a wide selection of solutions available that you can try to fix this issue for good.

## What Causes the Error Code 0xc00000f on a Windows PC?

 Again, like [troubleshooting the majority of Windows' error codes](https://www.makeuseof.com/find-stop-codes-and-fix-windows-errors/), your Windows error code 0xc000000f could've been caused by a variety of reasons. So it isn't easy to point to something specific. However, there's a slew of possible recurrent causes:

1. **Incorrect BIOS Settings:** Did you face an abrupt shutdown recently? If so, that can easily mess up your BIOS settings. Or maybe you'd tweaked something yourself. Whatever the case, if you've some weird configuration, it might be time to set everything straight.
2. **Windows Update problems:** A failed or badly done Windows update can also lead you to many error codes. Your error code 0xc000000f can be one of the many reasons for this.
3. **Virus & Malware infections:** If you were recently hit by a malware attack, facing a blue screen error code is not out of the question.
4. **Problems with boot configuration:** BCD holds data about your PC's boot configuration. So if something goes wrong with this, you are bound to suffer problems with your boot configuration.

## Fixing the Error Code 0xc000000f on Windows

 Again, while nobody can tell you the exact reasons for getting hit by a Windows error code 0xc000000f, there are ways to fix this debilitating error. Let's look at them all.

## 1\. Reboot Your PC

 Before you dive into more complex solutions we suggest you go through a reboot first. It's one of the most tired cliches at this point, but a restart does have its merit and has been known to fix many problems on a computer or a smartphone.

 Basically, a restart clears your memory and resources, leaving you with a clean slate to start everything up. So give your PC a reboot and see if this fixes 0xc00000f.

## 2\. Run a Startup Repair

 The Startup Repair is a free, in-built Windows utility that helps you figure out and fix common Windows errors that stop you from booting up your Windows. Then, after the tool finds any bugs, it then works by getting rid of them for good.

 Here's how you can use Startup repair to fix error code 0xc00000f on your Windows PC:

1. Plug in Windows installation UBS stick into your Windows.
2. Now boot up your PC from the installation media.
3. Select your language and then select **Repair your computer**.
4. Click on **Troubleshoot**.
5. Now, click on **Advanced options**.
6. Search for the **Startup Repair** option and select it.

 Now, follow the on-screen instructions and fix and diagnose the issues giving you the system booting error.

 That's it; the startup repair will fix any problems giving you the error code 0xc00000f and boot up your PC as usual. If it didn't do the job, there are [things to try if Startup Repair fails to fix your PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-to-do-if-startup-repair-fails-to-repair-your-pc/).

## 3\. Check Your Hardware

![computer hardware](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/computer-hardware.jpg)

 How long have you been using your computer? It's possible that there's something wrong with your computer's hardware, especially if you've been it for a while now. Indeed, losing internal components to wear and tear caused by heat, usage, etc., is very common for any computer.

 If that's the case here, it wouldn't be too surprising to encounter the 0xc00000f error code on your Windows PC. Check out our short [guide on figuring out hardware failures on your Windows PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-test-your-pc-for-failing-hardware/).

 Then, depending on the results, get your PC fixed as soon as possible.

## 4\. Watch Out For Disk Errors

 A faulty disk, which itself can be caused by a variety of reasons, can almost always lead to errors like the 0xc00000f error code on your PC.

 So, if you believe that's the case here, give the CHKDSK command a go.

* Head to the Command prompt, type in _**chkdsk f: /f**_, and hit **Enter**.
* Wait till the scan gets complete.

 As soon as you're done with the above step, the Check disk utility will begin scanning and performing the fixes for your hard disk, and then solve the 0xc00000f error code from there. However, if the problem persists, head to the method below.

## 5\. Rebuild BCD

 BCD, or Boot Configuration Data in full, stores information that lets your Windows boot up easily. Briefly, it tells the boot loader where to look for critical boot information, establishes boot priority, etc., to help you start up your PC.

 Facing the 0xc00000f error code is natural, especially if something has gone wrong with your BCD. To fix your BCD settings, then, follow the steps below:

* Plug in a Windows installation media and boot up your PC from that.
* Select the **Repair Your PC** option.
* Click on **Troubleshoot > Advanced Options**.
* Select the Command prompt and run the following commands one by one and hit **Enter**:  
`bootrec /fixmbrbootrec /fixbootbootrec /scanosbootrec /rebuildbcd`

 When prompted, press **Y** to restart your PC for the changes to take effect. That's it. This will rebuild your BCD, and any problems caused by the boot menu will be resolved on time.

## 6\. Perform a Factory Reset

 Does nothing seem to work? In this case, factory reset is your last resolution. Factory reset is the nuclear option for almost all Windows woes, and it works by wiping all the system data of your PC and starting your Windows from scratch.

 Check out our complete guide on [how to factory reset Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-ways-factory-reset-windows-computer/) for the different ways to perform one, and pick the one that suits you best.
