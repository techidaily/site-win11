## 3\. Check Your Hardware

![computer hardware](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/computer-hardware.jpg)

 How long have you been using your computer? It's possible that there's something wrong with your computer's hardware, especially if you've been it for a while now. Indeed, losing internal components to wear and tear caused by heat, usage, etc., is very common for any computer.

 If that's the case here, it wouldn't be too surprising to encounter the 0xc00000f error code on your Windows PC. Check out our short [guide on figuring out hardware failures on your Windows PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-test-your-pc-for-failing-hardware/).

## 4\. Watch Out For Disk Errors

 A faulty disk, which itself can be caused by a variety of reasons, can almost always lead to errors like the 0xc00000f error code on your PC.

 So, if you believe that's the case here, give the CHKDSK command a go.

* Head to the Command prompt, type in _**chkdsk f: /f**_, and hit **Enter**.
* Wait till the scan gets complete.

 As soon as you're done with the above step, the Check disk utility will begin scanning and performing the fixes for your hard disk, and then solve the 0xc00000f error code from there. However, if the problem persists, head to the method below.

## 5\. Rebuild BCD

 BCD, or Boot Configuration Data in full, stores information that lets your Windows boot up easily. Briefly, it tells the boot loader where to look for critical boot information, establishes boot priority, etc., to help you start up your PC.

 Facing the 0xc00000f error code is natural, especially if something has gone wrong with your BCD. To fix your BCD settings, then, follow the steps below:

* Plug in a Windows installation media and boot up your PC from that.
* Select the **Repair Your PC** option.
* Click on **Troubleshoot > Advanced Options**.
* Select the Command prompt and run the following commands one by one and hit **Enter**:  
`bootrec /fixmbrbootrec /fixbootbootrec /scanosbootrec /rebuildbcd`

 When prompted, press **Y** to restart your PC for the changes to take effect. That's it. This will rebuild your BCD, and any problems caused by the boot menu will be resolved on time.

## 6\. Perform a Factory Reset

 Does nothing seem to work? In this case, factory reset is your last resolution. Factory reset is the nuclear option for almost all Windows woes, and it works by wiping all the system data of your PC and starting your Windows from scratch.

 Check out our complete guide on [how to factory reset Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-ways-factory-reset-windows-computer/) for the different ways to perform one, and pick the one that suits you best.
