 Microsoft Store is an online marketplace pre-installed on Windows. It offers a diverse array of free and paid apps, games, and even device updates, all in one place. This gives Windows users access to everything they need under one roof.

 To install Microsoft PowerToys from the Microsoft Store, follow these steps:

1. Press **Win + Q** and type **Microsoft Store** in the search bar.
2. Click on the **Microsoft Store** icon in the search results.
3. On the Microsoft Store page, search for **PowerToys**. The next page will provide a detailed overview of the software package. Please read it carefully before continuing.
4. If you feel satisfied, click **Install** to begin the downloading & installation process. The process might take a few minutes.
