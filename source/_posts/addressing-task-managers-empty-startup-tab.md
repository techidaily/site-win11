 There’s a possibility that the issue at hand might be caused by system issues. In such instances, scanning and repairing your device’s hard drive could help.

 Here’s how you can resolve the problem using a Check Disk (CHKDSK) scan:

1. Type**Command Prompt** in the Start menu search bar.
2. Right-click on the**Best match** result and select**Run as administrator** .
3. Type the following command and then press**Enter** to scan and repair your hard drive:

 If your Windows operating system (OS) is installed on a different drive, then replace**C:** in the command with the letter of the relevant drive.

Finally, restart your device when the scan is complete.

![Computer antivirus illustration](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Computer-antivirus-illustration.jpg)

 If a normal disk scan doesn’t help, then you’d need to scan and repair your hard drive using advanced tools such as DISM and SFC. As we covered in our guide on [how to repair corrupted files with built-in Windows tools](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-built-in-repair-tools/) , DISM and SFC are handy services that can help repair Windows errors.

2. Click**File** in the top-left corner and select**Run new task** .

4. Press**OK** to run the Command Prompt.
5. Type the following command and press**Enter** :

`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth`

 Wait for the process to complete. From there, type the following command and press**Enter** :

`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth`

Finally, restart your device once the DISM scan is complete.

Now, you can run the SFC tool through these steps:

1. Open the**Command Prompt** by following the previous steps.
2. Type the following command and press**Enter** to run the scan:

`sfc /scannow`

Wait for the scan to complete and then restart your device.

Now, here are the steps for disabling the Windows Defender Firewall:

1. Type**Control Panel** in the Start menu search bar and select the**Best match** .
2. Click the**View by** drop-down menu and then select**Large icons** .

## 7\. Use a System Restore Point

 Using a system restore point can help you tackle the issue at hand. However, this approach will only help if you’ve already learned [how to create a system restore point in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) and made one.

 During the restoration process, the system restore tool will revert your PC to a previous state. As such, this tool will help only if the Task Manager error only started appearing recently.

 Here’s how you can tackle the issue at hand using a restore point:

1. Type "Create a restore point" in the Start menu search bar and select the**Best match** .
2. Click the**System Protection** tab and then select**System Restore** from the options.
3. Press**Next** to continue.
4. Select**Show more restore points** and then pick a restore point.
5. Click**Next** and then click**Finish** to finalize the process.

Here are the steps for updating Windows:

1. Type**Settings** in the Start menu search bar and select the**Best match** .
