![A PC screen showing a Security text](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/security.jpg)

 AI-based security systems can detect threats and attacks that may be missed by traditional systems. These systems, like Windows 10’s Microsoft Defender, use machine learning to analyze behavioral patterns and identify anomalies that indicate security threats.

 Consequently, AI-powered antivirus software can detect and block malware in real-time. They scan files and programs for malicious code and identify and remove it before it can do any damage. What’s more, they can monitor user behavior and detect suspicious activities.

 For example, if a user suddenly starts accessing files or applications they don't normally use, the system can flag this as suspicious behavior and take appropriate action.

 Furthermore, AI-based security systems can use predictive analysis to identify potential threats before they occur. They can analyze data from various sources to identify patterns and trends that could indicate potential attacks.

 AI is revolutionizing Windows software security by providing more intelligent systems that can detect and prevent cyber-attacks in real-time, making computers more secure and reliable for end-users.

## 3\. Automated Updates

 AI has introduced several quality-of-life features to Windows users. One such feature is automated updates, which use machine learning to help Windows users keep up with the latest software updates and security patches.

 Traditionally, updating Windows software is a manual process that requires users to download and install updates themselves, which is time-consuming and lead to security vulnerabilities. With automated updates, AI algorithms can detect the latest software patches, download, and install them without user intervention.

 Fortunately, Microsoft still lets you[update Windows manually](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-manually/) if need be, so the option isn't totally gone. However, Windows does do a good job automating the update process.

 AI algorithms can also analyze usage patterns and system performance data to identify potential issues that could impact software stability or security. By analyzing this data, AI can recommend updates that can improve the performance or stability of a user's system.
