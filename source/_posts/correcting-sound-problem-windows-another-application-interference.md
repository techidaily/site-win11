6. If the service is not running, right-click on**Windows Audio** and select**Start** .
7. Close the Services snap-in and restart your PC. After the restart, your audio device should start working again.

## 4\. Disable and Re-Enable the Sound Output Device

![Uninstalling an audio device in Windows 11.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/uninstalling-audio-device-windows-11.jpg)

 You can also troubleshoot your audio problems by uninstalling the audio device and the associated drivers. Reinstalling the audio device can help if the sound problem is due to corrupt audio drivers.

To uninstall your audio device on Windows:

1. Press**Win + X** to open the**WinX menu** .
2. Select**Device Manager** for the menu.
3. In Device Manager, expand the**Audio inputs and output section** .
4. Right-click on your audio device and select**Uninstall device** .

## 6\. Perform a Driver Rollback

 If you have an external sound card and have installed an update, try a driver rollback. A new driver update can sometimes create more problems than it intends to fix. You can use the device driver rollback feature in Device Manager to undo the changes and reinstall the older version of the driver.

 You can[roll back a driver using Windows Device Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-10/) . In Device Manager, expand the**Sound, Video, and Game Controllers** section. Next, access your external sound card properties to perform a rollback.

 If the Roll Back Driver option is greyed out, it means the option is unavailable for the selected device. In this instance, uninstall the existing audio device driver and download an older version of the driver from your sound card manufacturer's website. Your sound card manufacturer may also have a newer driver version available. If available, install the latest version and check for any improvements.

## 7\. Install Pending Windows Updates

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![volume mixer windows 11 view audio applications](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/volume-mixer-windows-11-view-audio-applications.jpg)

 If the issue persists, check if there is a third-party app conflict. You can use Volume Mixer to view applications accessing the audio devices and close the problematic app to fix the problem. Here’s how to do it.

1. Press**Win + R** to open Run.
2. Type**sndvol** and click**OK** to open Volume Mixer.
3. The**Application** column will show all the apps using your audio device.

## Fixing the Audio Device in Use By Another Application Error

Also, disable exclusive application access to audio devices and configure the Windows Audio service to start automatically.
