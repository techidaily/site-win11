## 4\. Disable and Re-Enable the Sound Output Device

 You can temporarily disable and re-enable the audio device to fix any glitches causing the device to malfunction. You can[disable the audio device](https://www.makeuseof.com/enable-disable-sound-output-devices-in-windows/) using the Settings app and Device Manager.

 To disable the audio device, right-click on the audio device and select**Disable device** in**Device Manager** . Next, right-click on the audio device and**Enable Device** . Close Device Manager and check for any improvements.

## 5\. Uninstall and Reinstall the Audio Device and Driver

![Uninstalling an audio device in Windows 11.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/uninstalling-audio-device-windows-11.jpg)

 You can also troubleshoot your audio problems by uninstalling the audio device and the associated drivers. Reinstalling the audio device can help if the sound problem is due to corrupt audio drivers.

To uninstall your audio device on Windows:

1. Press**Win + X** to open the**WinX menu** .
2. Select**Device Manager** for the menu.
3. In Device Manager, expand the**Audio inputs and output section** .
4. Right-click on your audio device and select**Uninstall device** .
5. Read the warning and click**Uninstall** to confirm the action. Wait for the device to uninstall.

 You may see a yellow exclamation mark on the uninstalled audio device. To reinstall the driver, click on**File** and select**Scan for hardware changes** . This should reinstall the sound device and driver. If not, restart your computer. As the system restarts, Windows will reinstall the missing audio device driver and restore sound on your computer.

## 6\. Perform a Driver Rollback

 If you have an external sound card and have installed an update, try a driver rollback. A new driver update can sometimes create more problems than it intends to fix. You can use the device driver rollback feature in Device Manager to undo the changes and reinstall the older version of the driver.

 You can[roll back a driver using Windows Device Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-10/) . In Device Manager, expand the**Sound, Video, and Game Controllers** section. Next, access your external sound card properties to perform a rollback.

 If the Roll Back Driver option is greyed out, it means the option is unavailable for the selected device. In this instance, uninstall the existing audio device driver and download an older version of the driver from your sound card manufacturer's website. Your sound card manufacturer may also have a newer driver version available. If available, install the latest version and check for any improvements.

## 7\. Install Pending Windows Updates

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 To install Windows update, go to**Settings > Windows Update** and click**Check for updates** . Windows will populate the screen with all the pending updates. You can install the updates or selectively install any audio device updates.

## 8\. Check for Third-Party App Conflict

![volume mixer windows 11 view audio applications](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/volume-mixer-windows-11-view-audio-applications.jpg)

1. Press**Win + R** to open Run.
2. Type**sndvol** and click**OK** to open Volume Mixer.
3. The**Application** column will show all the apps using your audio device.

## Fixing the Audio Device in Use By Another Application Error

Also, disable exclusive application access to audio devices and configure the Windows Audio service to start automatically.
