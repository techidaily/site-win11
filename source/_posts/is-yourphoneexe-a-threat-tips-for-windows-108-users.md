 If you don’t use the Phone Link app or if the yourphone.exe process continues to appear even after disabling background app permissions, you can uninstall the app completely from your Windows computer.

 To uninstall the Phone Link app:

1. Press the **Win** key and type **PowerShell**.
2. Next, right-click on **PowerShell** from the search results and select **Run as administrator**.
3. In the PowerShell window, type the following command and press Enter:  
`Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.YourPhone -AllUsers | Remove-AppxPackage`
4. Once the command is executed, it’ll remove the Phone Link app from your computer.

 You can re-install the Phone Link app from the Microsoft Store if you want to give the app another shot.
