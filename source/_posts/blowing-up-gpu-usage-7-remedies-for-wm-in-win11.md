 Now, monitor your computer's GPU consumption. If it remains high, there's a possibility that corruption in important system files is causing the issue.

## 7\. Run an SFC Scan

 Itâ€™s common for Windows files to become corrupted due to malware attacks or sudden system crashes. Unfortunately, corruption in these system files not only results in data loss but also disrupts the regular functioning of your computer.

 While recovering the lost data might prove challenging, repairing the corrupt files to resolve ongoing system issues is relatively easy.

 SFC, or System File Checker, is a Windows built-in utility that looks for and repairs current system files. To run an SFC scan, open Command Prompt as an administrator (see how to [launch Command Prompt with administrative rights](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/)), type **sfc /scannow**, and press **Enter**.

![Sfc scan in Command Prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sfc-scan.jpg)

 After the scan is complete, restart your computer, and you will see that youâ€™re no longer facing the Desktop Window Manager high GPU consumption issue.

## Prevent the Desktop Window Manager From Hogging Your GPU

 Excessive GPU consumption can cause various graphics-related issues on your computer. Hopefully, the above solutions will help you fix the Desktop Window Manager's high GPU usage.

 However, if you are still struggling with the problem, the issue may be related to your hardware. In that case, you should replace it with a new one.
