## Windows 10/11: Mastering the Art of Clearing Security History

 Windows Defender is Microsoft's antivirus built into your Windows PC to protect you from viruses, malware threats, and attacks. It maintains a record of its scans and actions in its Protection History folder.

 Though Protection History gets deleted after some time, you might want to have more control to clear it by yourself. So let's see how you can clear Protection History in four ways.

## What Is the Microsoft Defender Protection History? Why Should You Clear It?

 One of the best antivirus for your PC, [Windows Defender keeps getting better with some powerful upgrades](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-defender-riskai-upgrade/). The detections made by Windows Defender appear on the Protection History page—which means you can view actions that Microsoft Defender Antivirus has taken on your behalf. These would be scans done to identify and block malware and other threats. And also the recommendations (highlighted in red or yellow) for actions you should take.

 You also have access to all this information in a clear and easily understandable form, including Potentially Unwanted Apps that have been removed, or key services that have been turned off. The Protection History will also show the detections that appear while performing a Windows Defender Offline scan.

![Protection History Page in Windows Security](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ProtectionHistory1.jpg)

 Though Windows Defender keeps the history of its detections for 30 days, you can clear it before that time if you need to—for example, when a lot of scan logs have accumulated. Clearing the Protection History would help you make space on your PC and keep Defender running smoothly. Remember, you must be signed in as an administrator to clear the protection history so [do check if you have administrative rights](https://www.makeuseof.com/check-windows-account-admin-rights/).

 Now let's see four easy ways to clear Protection History in Windows 10 and 11\.

## 1\. How to Clear the Microsoft Defender's Protection History Folder

1. Press **Windows + R** keys to bring up the Run box.

## 3\. How to Clear the Microsoft Defender Protection History via PowerShell

 What if you want the Protection History to clear automatically after a specific number of days? You can also use a PowerShell command to do that. Let's see how to do this:

1. Type **PowerShell** in the search bar. Right-click on **Windows PowerShell** under **Best match** and select **Run as administrator**. Or choose **Run as administrator** on the right search pane.
2. Click **Yes** on the UAC prompt that appears.
3. The **Administrator: PowerShell** window will open up. Type or copy and paste the following command and then hit **enter**:

`Set-MpPreference -ScanPurgeItemsAfterDelay 7`

![Command to Clear Protection History in PowerShell](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PowerShell-Command-to-Clear-Protection-History.jpg)

 The number **7** at the end of the command is the number of days after which the protection history logs will be cleared. Just change that number to specify when you want the protection history to be cleared. And it will be cleared automatically.

## 4\. How to Clear the Microsoft Defender Protection History Using the Group Policy Editor

 If you have a PC with Windows 10 Pro, Windows 11 Pro, or a higher version, you can also use the Group Policy Editor to clear the Defender Protection History automatically. Though there are solutions to [access the Group Policy Editor on Windows Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/) too. But let's see how to clear Protection History via Group Policy Editor in Windows Pro and higher versions:

1. Press **Win + R** keys to open the Run box. Type **gpedit.msc** to open the **Local Group Policy Editor**. Or just type **gpedit** in the search bar and click on **Edit Group Policy** under **Best match** to open it.
2. In the **Local Group Policy Editor**, on the left pane under **Computer Configuration**, expand **Administrative Templates** by clicking on the down arrow next to it.
3. Inside the **Administrative Templates** folder, click on **Windows Components** and the list of its components would come up on the middle pane of the **Group Policy Editor**.
4. Then scroll down to find **Windows Defender Antivirus** and double-click on it.  
![Navigate to Windows Defender Antivirus in Group Policy Editor](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Navigate-to-Windows-Defender-Antivirus-in-Group-Policy-Editor.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

6. In the right pane, **double-click** on **Turn on removal of items from scan history folder**. Or click **Edit policy setting** in the middle pane. This policy setting defines the number of days items should be kept in the scan history folder before being permanently removed.  
![Turn on Removal of Items Policy in Defender Scan Folder](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Edit-Removal-of-Items-Policy-in-Defender-Scan-Folder.jpg)
7. Next, select **Edit policy setting** to open the policy window. It would be showing **Not Configured** by default. To set the number of days, toggle on the button next to **Enabled**. The default number of days, which is **30**, would then be set. If you set the number of days to zero, items will be kept forever and will not be automatically removed. So just change the days to whenever you want the items to be removed. Finally, click **Apply** and then **OK**.
