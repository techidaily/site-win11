## 1\. Start With Generic Fixes

 Before we get to any advanced troubleshooting tips, it’s a good idea to first try some basic solutions mentioned below.

* **Rule Out Issues With Your Internet Connection:** A weak or unstable internet connection could be the reason why you are unable to upload files in Chrome. To test your connection, open a new tab in Chrome and navigate to a reliable [internet speed test website](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-websites-test-internet-speed/). If there is an issue with your internet, consider [restarting your router](https://www.makeuseof.com/reboot-router-correct-way/) or switching to a different network connection, and then try again.
* **Restart Chrome:** Sometimes, the simplest solutions are the most effective. It is possible that a temporary browser glitch is causing file upload issues in Chrome. If that is the case, restarting Chrome should resolve the problem.
* **Clear Cache and Cookies:** Outdated or corrupted browsing data could also cause such problems. You can try [clearing the cache and cookies in Google Chrome](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clear-cookies-cache-in-chrome/) to see if that solves the issue.

## 2\. Use an Incognito Window

 One of the key advantages of using Chrome is its wide range of extension support. However, not all third-party extensions are reliable. There’s a chance that one of your extensions is causing Chrome to become unresponsive or crash when you upload files from your Windows PC.

 To rule out this possibility, you can try using Chrome in incognito mode, which loads the browser without any of your third-party extensions. To open an incognito window in Chrome, click the **three-dot menu** icon in the top-right corner, and select **New Incognito window**.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 After that, try uploading files and check if the issue occurs again.

## 3\. Disable Browser Extensions

 If you are able to upload files without issue in an incognito window, it is likely that one of your extensions is causing the problem. To identify it, you will need to disable all of the extensions and then re-enable them one at a time.

 To disable extensions in Google Chrome, follow these steps:

1. Open Google Chrome and click the **three-dot menu** icon in the top right corner.
2. Hover the cursor over **More tools** and then select **Extensions** from the submenu.
3. Use the toggles to disable all the extensions.  
![Disable Chrome Extensions](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/disable-chrome-extensions.jpg)

 Restart Chrome after this, and then enable your extensions one at a time. You will need to upload a test file after enabling each extension until the issue occurs again. Once you find the extension that is causing the issue, consider removing it.

## 4\. Disable Energy Saver Mode in Chrome

 When you [enable Energy Saver mode in Chrome](https://www.makeuseof.com/enable-google-chrome-energy-saver-mode/), it limits certain background processes and visual effects to conserve battery life. However, this feature might cause your file uploads to fail in Chrome, especially if you are uploading large files.

 Therefore, it is best to disable Energy Saver mode in Chrome if you are experiencing difficulties. Here are the steps for the same.

1. Open Chrome, click the **three-dot menu** icon in the top right corner, and select **Settings**.
2. Use the left pane to switch to the **Performance** tab.
3. Disable the toggle next to **Energy saver**.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 After completing the above steps, see if you can upload files without any issues.

## 5\. Disable Your Antivirus

 Many third-party antivirus programs have web protection features that are intended to safeguard you while you browse the internet. However, these antivirus programs can sometimes be intrusive and prevent file uploads in Chrome.

 To check for this possibility, you can temporarily disable your antivirus program on Windows. To do so, simply right-click on the antivirus program's taskbar icon, and select **Disable > Disable until the next restart**.

![Temporarily disable antivirus](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/disable-antivirus.jpg)

 If this solves your problem, you will need to review the web protection settings in your antivirus program and make the necessary changes to avoid any issues.

## 6\. Install Any Pending Google Chrome Updates

 Another reason why you might be unable to upload files in Google Chrome is if you are using an outdated or buggy version of the browser. Although Google Chrome typically updates automatically, this may not happen if you have not closed the browser in a while.

 To check for and install pending Google Chrome updates, use these steps:

1. Open Google Chrome and click the **menu icon** (three vertical dots) in the top-right corner.
2. Select **Help > About Google Chrome**.
3. Wait for Chrome to download pending updates, and then click the **Relaunch** button to install them.  
![Install Chrome Updates](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/install-chrome-updates.jpg)

 Once you have updated Chrome, your file uploads should work as expected.

## 7\. Create a New Chrome Profile

 Issues with your Chrome profile can also cause the browser to malfunction. This could happen if your Chrome profile has become corrupted. You can try creating a new user profile in Chrome to see if that fixes the problem. Here's how to do that.

1. Open Google Chrome and click on your **profile icon** in the top-right corner.
2. Select **Add** from the resulting menu.
3. Choose whether you want to sign in with or without an account.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Switch to the newly created profile and try to upload files again. If this fixes your problem, you can consider [deleting the old Google Chrome profile](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-delete-google-chrome-profile/).

## 8\. Reset Chrome Settings

 If you still can't upload files in Google Chrome, you can reset the browser as a last resort. This will remove all of your custom settings, disable extensions, and delete other temporary data. However, your saved bookmarks and passwords will not be affected, so you don't need to worry about them.

 To reset Google Chrome on Windows:

1. Launch Google Chrome and click the **three-dot menu** in the top right corner.
2. Select **Settings** from the resulting menu.
3. Select **Reset settings** from the left sidebar.
4. Click the **Restore settings to their original defaults** option in the right pane.
5. Click **Reset settings** to confirm.
