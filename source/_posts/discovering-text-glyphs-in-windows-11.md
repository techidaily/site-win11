## Discovering Text Glyphs in Windows 11

 If you're working with text, sooner or later you will need to use special characters. On Windows, there's a tool called Character Map that lets you view and use all the characters available in the installed fonts. With this tool, you can create documents or website designs that require symbols or characters not found on a standard keyboard.

 If you would like to access all of these characters, you will need to open up the Character Map application. Here is how to do that in Windows 11.

## 1\. How to Open Character Map Using Windows Search

 If you need to use special characters in your documents, the Character Map tool can help. This tool is built into Windows and can be opened using the Windows Search tool. Here's how to open it.

1. Press**Win + Q** on your keyboard to open the Windows Search box.

2. Type "character map" in the search box and hit the**Enter** key.

 Once you've opened Character Map, you can select a font from the drop-down menu at the top of the window. Then, scroll through the list of available characters and click on the one you want to insert. Finally, click the Copy button and paste the character into your document or email.

## 2\. How to Open Character Map Using the Run Dialog

2. Type "charmap" into the text box and press the**Enter** key. The Character Map window will now appear on your screen.

## 3\. How to Open Character Map From the Start Menu
