## How to Remap Keys and Shortcuts With the Keyboard Manager

 The Keyboard Manager lets you remap keys and shortcuts on your keyboard with the keys you are most comfortable typing with.

### How to Remap Keys to Type Faster

To remap your keys with Keyboard Manager:

1. Open PowerToys on your PC by searching for it on**Windows Search** and clicking**PowerToys** under**Best match** . Or double-click the**PowerToys icon** in the system tray. The**PowerToys Settings** screen will open up.
2. Click on**Keyboard Manager** on the left pane. Then**Enable Keyboard Manager** by turning its toggle on in the right pane.
3. Click on**Remap a key** to open the**Remap keys** window.  
![Keyboard Manager Settings in PowerToys](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/keyboard-manager-settings-powertoys.jpg)
4. Press the**down arrow** under the**Type** button in the**Physical Key** section, and select a key like**P** . Then under the**Mapped to** section, click on the**down arrow** under**Type** and select a key like**S** to map the physical key.  
![P Key Remapped to Key S in Remap Keys Window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/remap-keyp-to-keys.jpg)
5. Finally, click on the blue**OK** button on top and click on**Continue Anyway** on the warning prompt. Now when you type P on your keyboard, the letter S will get typed.

 Remapping a key is also handy if a key stops functioning. You can map it to another key till you get the faulty key fixed or buy a new keyboard.

 You can also map shortcuts like Ctrl + I to a key. Click on the**plus sign** under**Physical Key.** Then click on the**Type** button. Next, select a key like**F1** by pressing it on the keyboard. Then click**OK** .

 Now under the**Mapped to** section, click on the**Type** button. Now press**Ctrl + I** or the Italicize shortcut on the keyboard to map the**F1** key to it.

 Now, when you need to italicize a text, instead of Ctrl + I, just press a single key, F1\. So you'll automatically be typing faster.

 This way, you could remap many alphabet and number keys, and even function keys to speed up your work. Think of all the milliseconds and seconds you will save whenever you type.

### How to Remap Shortcuts to Type Faster

 Below the**Remap a key** option you'll find the**Remap a shortcut** option. Click on it to open**Remap shortcuts** window. You can remap common shortcuts to other shortcuts you prefer to use.

 For example, instead of pressing**Ctrl + B** keys to make a text bold, you'd rather use**Shift (left) + Z** —Shift (left) + Z keys are next to each other and easier and faster to press together. So in the**Remap Shortcuts** window, type**Shift (left) + Z** under**Physical Shortcut** and**Ctrl + B** under the**Mapped to** section.

 You can choose**All Apps** as the Target App or an app such as**Word** , where you want this remapped shortcut to work. But remember to put the executable name or**EXE name** of the Word app, which is**Winword** . You can easily find the EXE names of apps via a Google search.

![Shift + Z Physical Shortcut Mapped to Ctrl + B Shortcut](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/remap-shortcuts-powertoys.jpg)

 Finally, click on the blue**OK** button and click**Continue Anyway** on the prompt.

 Now you can bold text with your preferred shortcut and type faster on your favorite app.
