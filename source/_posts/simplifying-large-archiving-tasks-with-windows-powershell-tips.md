## Simplifying Large Archiving Tasks with Windows PowerShell Tips

 Are you running out of space on your Windows PC? The best thing you can do to free up some space is to compress big files through zipping. There are plenty of third-party tools that can come in handy in this situation.

 However, if you prefer to use Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell over anything else, there are commands you can use in these utilities to zip or unzip files. So, let's check out how to zip or unzip files using Command Prompt and Windows PowerShell.

## How to Zip Files Using Command Prompt

 You can zip files through Command Prompt using the tar command. It's a command line tool that helps you to extract files and create archives. However, this command only works in Windows 10 or later.

Here's how to zip files using Command Prompt:

1. Open the**Start Menu** by pressing the**Win** key.
2. In the search bar, type**Command Prompt** and**Run as administrator** from the right pane.
3. In the console, type the following command and press**Enter** . Replace**'Place'** with the location of the file.  
`cd Place`

4. Type**dir** and press**Enter** . It'll show the files inside the selected folder.

5. To zip all the files inside the selected folder, type the following command and press**Enter** . Replace '**Compressed** ' with the name you want to give your folder where the zip file will be stored. Also, replace '**FileExt** ' with the extension of the file you're zipping.  
`tar -a -c -f Compressed.zip *.FileExt`  
![Tar command in CMD](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tar.jpg)
6. To zip a single file, execute the following command. Again, replace '**Compressed** ' with the name you want to give your folder where the zip file will be stored, '**FileExt** ' with your file's extension, and '**FileName** ' with the name of the file you want to zip.  
`tar -a -c -f Compressed.zip FileName.FileExt`

## How to Zip Files Using Windows PowerShell

 There are several viable ways to[create zip files on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/easy-ways-create-zip-file-windows-10/) . One of these is through Windows PowerShell. However, the**tar** command doesn't work in Windows PowerShell; we'll use another command to get the work done.

Here's how to zip files using Windows PowerShell:

1. Open the Start Menu, type**Windows PowerShell,** and choose Run as administrator from the right pane.
2. In the console, type the following command and press**Enter** . Ensure to replace**file destination** and**target location** with the location of the file and the place where you want the file to be zipped, respectively. Also, replace**file name** with the name of the file you want to zip and**destination name** with the destination folder name.  
`Compress-Archive -LiteralPath 'file destination\file name' -DestinationPath 'target location\destination name'`

 If you want to zip multiple files, execute the following command. Replace**file destination** and**file destination 1** with the location of the first and second files, respectively. And replace**file name** and**file name 2** with the first and second file names.

`Compress-Archive -LiteralPath 'file destination\file name', 'file destination 1\file name 2 -DestinationPath 'target location\destination name'  
`
