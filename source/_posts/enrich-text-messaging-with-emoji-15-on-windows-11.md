## Enrich Text Messaging with Emoji 15 on Windows 11

 The Unicode Consortium releases a new set of emoticons every year to help us express ourselves better. The latest offering from Unicode is Emoji 15, which is expected to reach all major platforms by the end of 2023, including Windows 11.

 However, you may not need to wait until the end of 2023 for Microsoft to enable access to Emoji 15 on Windows 11\. If you are running Windows 11 Dev Channel Insider build 23500 or higher, you can now enable Emoji 15 on your Windows 11 PC.

## What Is ViveTool, and Why You Need It to Enable Emoji 15?

 ViveTool is an important piece of software for those looking to enable hidden features on Windows 11\. It is particularly popular among Windows Insiders, but those running stable Windows 11 updates can also use it.

We have a detailed guide on [downloading and using ViveTool to enable new features](http://www.makeuseof.com/vivetool-windows-guide/) .

 After setting up ViveTool on your Windows 11 PC, you need to enable the feature ID specific to the Emoji 15 support. You can follow the below steps to enable the feature ID for the latest set of emojis from Unicode on Windows 11:

1. Open Command Prompt as an Administrator (see [how to open Command Prompt as Administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/) for steps).
2. Type the following command and hit**Enter** :  
cd C:\ViVeTool
3. Copy and paste the following command and press**Enter** :  
vivetool /enable /id:40213648

 Once completed, you will see a message on your screen that says, "Successfully set feature configuration (s)." The final step is restarting your computer so that the changes you just made can take effect.

 After the restart, you will see on your emoji keyboard a bunch of new emoticons based on the Unicode 15 standard on your PC. The emoji keyboard will appear on your PC screen after you press the**Win key** +**. (period key)** on your keyboard.

## What Do You Get in Emoji 15?

 According to the Draft Release Notes of Unicode's Emoji v15, there are only 31 recommended emojis this year, significantly less than last year's 112 recommendations. In fact, Unicode has never recommended a set of new emojis this small in its history. Also, it has happened for the first time that the recommended list does not include any new people emoji.

## When Will Microsoft Bring Emoji 15 to Every Windows 11 User?

 Emoji 15 may remain an exclusive feature for Windows Insiders, at least until the release of the Windows 11 22H2 Moment 3 update. It is possible that Microsoft will begin rolling out the Emoji 15 support via Windows 11 Moment 3, due in April. Either way, when it is generally available to everyone, you will no longer need the ViveTool to access Unicode's latest set of emojis on your PC.
