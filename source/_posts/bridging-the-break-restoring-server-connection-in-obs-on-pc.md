## What Causes "Failed to Connect to Server" Error in OBS Studio?

 The "Failed to connect to server" is among the most common errors you will come across while streaming or recording in OBS studio. Some of the common culprits behind this error are:

1. You're using an incorrect software version.
2. Windows Firewall is interfering and blocking the important services of the OBS Studio.
3. You're running OBS Studio without administrative privileges.
4. The in-app settings are not compatible with your network settings.

 Having identified the reasons behind the issue, let's get into fixes that helped others users troubleshoot the problem.

## 1\. Try Performing Basic Repairs

 The first thing you must do to troubleshoot the problem is to restart OBS Studio. The best way is to close all the OBS Studio-related processes from the Task Manager. Then, start OBS Studio again and check if the problem continues.

 OBS Studio is available for both 32 and 64-bit computers. While you can install the 64-bit version on a 32-bit computer, it will create different issues if you try to run it.

 Therefore, you must check the Windows version of your computer and install OBS Studio accordingly. To check the Windows version, follow the below instructions:

1. Open the**Settings menu** by pressing the**Win** **\+ I** hotkeys.
2. Head towards**System** \>**About.**

 Under the**Device specifications** section, check the value next to the**System type.**

 The error message can also appear if you try to run OBS Studio without administrative privileges. To fix this, right-click the OBS Studio executable file and choose the**Run as administrator** option.

 Lack of administrative privileges will cause different issues now and then. To avoid this, you must configure OBS Studio to always run as an administrator. Here's how to do it:

1. Right-click on the OBS Studio executable file and choose**Properties.**
2. Switch to the**Compatibility** tab and check the**Run this program as an administrator** option.
3. Click**Apply** \>**OK** to save the changes.

That's it. Launch OBS Studio and check if the problem persists.

 If you are also running one of[the best OBS Studio alternatives](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-obs-studio-live-streaming-alternatives/) on your PC, it can result in a software conflict. To stop this from happening, close all these apps and their background processes. You can also uninstall them if you use them sparingly.

2. Select the**Advanced option** in the left panel.
3. Click the**drop-down** icon next to the**Bind to IP** option. It'll be under the**Network** section.
