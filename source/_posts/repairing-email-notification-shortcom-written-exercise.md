2. Navigate to**System > Power & battery** .

## 8\. Repair or Reset the Mail App

## 9\. Update the Mail App

 If you don’t update your apps on a regular basis, they will get outdated eventually. It's possible that the Mail app notifications aren't working because of a faulty app version. If that’s the case, updating the app will help more often than not.

 Head over to the Microsoft Store on your PC. Search for**Mail and calendar** app and click the**Update** button. If you do not see the Update option, then the app is already up-to-date.
