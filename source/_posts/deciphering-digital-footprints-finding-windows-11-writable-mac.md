## Deciphering Digital Footprints: Finding Windows 11' Writable MAC

 Every device that connects to the internet has a Media Access Control (MAC) address that uniquely identifies it online. Your Windows PC, smartphone, tablet, and smartwatch have a unique MAC address that allows it to communicate with other devices over the internet.

 The 12-character alphanumeric MAC address is defined within the network adapter of your device by the manufacturer. It is typically used to set up network routing protocols or send data across a network. You might also need it to customize your network.

 So, how do you find your Windows 11's MAC address? Read on to find out.
