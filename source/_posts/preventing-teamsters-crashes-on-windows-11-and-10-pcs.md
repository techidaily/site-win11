## Preventing Teamsters Crashes on Windows 11 & 10 PCs

 Microsoft Teams is one of the many pre-installed apps in Windows 11\. Unfortunately, while it is an excellent business collaboration platform, it is plagued by the occasional crashing issues.

 If the Microsoft Teams app is crashing or keeps restarting on your PC, here is how to troubleshoot and fix the problem in Windows 11\.

 Note that Microsoft offers two versions (Home and Work) of the Teams app. Due to differences in versions, some fixes below may not apply to the Teams (Work or School) version and vice versa.

## 1\. End the Microsoft Teams Process in Task Manager

![end microsoft teams process](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/end-microsoft-teams-process.png)

 You can kill and restart the Microsoft Teams process in Task Manager to fix crashing issues due to a temporary glitch. Here's how to do it:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the **Run** dialog.
2. Type **taskmgr** and click **OK** to open the Task Manager.
3. In the **Process** tab, look for any tasks associated with **Microsoft Teams.**
4. Select the process and click **End task.**
5. Close Task Manager and launch the Microsoft Teams app. Check if the app works without crashing.

 If the problem persists, perform a restart. A quick restart will force end all the background processes and help resolve issues due to temporary glitches.
