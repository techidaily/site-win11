## Unlocking Secrets of Windows' Function (Fn) Control Techniques

 The F1-F12 keys on the top of your keyboard can perform two functions. On their own, they perform one action, but they act differently when used with the Function (Fn) key. For the latter, you need to press the Fn key along with any function key every time you want to perform a distinct operation.

 If you don't want to keep holding down the Fn key, Windows gives you the option to permanently lock it. This will allow you to utilize F1-12's secondary operations without pressing the Fn key. Below, we discuss multiple ways of locking and unlocking the Fn key in detail.

## Why Should You Lock or Unlock the Fn Key?

 The F1-F12 keys can perform another secondary function apart from their default behavior when used in combination with the Fn key. However, you must press the Fn key every time you want to perform the alternate function. To make it more convenient, you can lock the Fn key, which will enable it permanently.

 When you want to use the default functions again, you can simply unlock the Fn key again

## How to Lock and Unlock the Function Key in Windows

 Below, we have listed different ways of locking and unlocking the Fn key in Windows.

### 1\. Use the Keyboard

 In several keyboards, the Esc key acts as a Function padlock key. You will notice a small padlock icon on the Esc key if that is the case for your keyboard.

 To lock the Fn key, simply press the Fn key and the Esc key together. Once the lock icon lights up, the Fn key has been successfully locked. To unlock, you can press both keys together again.
