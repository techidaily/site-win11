## Processors & Windows: Discovering Your CPU's Generation in 8 Steps

 Do you know what Intel processor generation is running on your computer? Is it the latest and most advanced model? Or is it an outdated version needing an upgrade? Knowing which Intel processor generation your computer is vital when upgrading, troubleshooting, and maximizing performance.

 Below are the steps to easily check which Intel processor generation you have on Windows.

## 1\. How to Check Your Intel's Processor Generation Using System Settings

 On Windows, you can quickly check your Intel processor generation through System Settings. To do this, go to the Windows Search bar and type "Settings". Then select **Settings** app from the search results. You can also use **Win + I** to open it directly.

 In the Settings window, click on the **System** option to open it. Next, on the right-side panel, scroll down and click **About** to view your system information.

 Here you can also check other details like Hardware IDs, Manufacturers, and Driver Providers. To view them, right-click on your processor and select **Properties**. Then switch to the **Details tab** and click the **Property** drop-down menu.

## 3\. How to Check Your Intel's Processor Generation Using the System Information Tool

 You can use the System Information tool for a thorough system report. This tool provides more than just Intel processor generation identification. It offers detailed insights into installed drivers, system models, BIOS versions, Windows versions, memory, and more.

 To open this tool, type **System Information** in the Windows search bar. Then select it from the search results. You can also use **Win + R** to open the Run command, type **msinfo32**, and hit **Enter**.

 Your processor name is in the **System Summary** section on the right-side panel.

## 4\. How to Check Your Intel's Processor Generation Using File Explorer

 If you're using Windows File Explorer, you don't even need to leave it. You can check your Intel processor generation right from the File Explorer window.

 To do this, click on **This PC** from the left side panel, then select **Properties**.

 This screen also shows Windows Edition, OS build, System type, and other details.

## 5\. How to Check Your Intel's Processor Generation Using Task Manager

 Task Manager is a native Windows tool that shows what programs and services are running on your computer. To open it, right-click on an empty space on your taskbar and select **Task Manager** from the pop-up menu. Alternatively, press the **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** keys to open it directly.

 You will see multiple tabs in the Task Manager window like Processes, Performance, App history, and more. Click on the **Performance** tab and expand the **CPU** section.

![Check Your Intel Processor Generation Using Task Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/check-your-intel-processor-generation-using-task-manager.jpg)

 Here you will find your processor name and Intel processor generation. For example, if you see **12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-12500H**, you have a 12th generation Intel Core i5 processor.

## 6\. How to Check Intel Processor Generation Using DirectX Diagnostic Tool

 The DirectX Diagnostic Tool is another Windows utility that provides detailed information about your system hardware and configuration. This tool is designed to troubleshoot DirectX sound and video issues, but you can also check your Intel processor generation.

 To open this tool, right-click on **Start** and select **Run**. Type **dxdiag** in the input field and click **OK** or press **Enter**. This command [opens the DirectX Diagnostic Tool](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-directx-diagnostic-tool/).

 In the DirectX Diagnostic Tool window, click on the **System** tab. Look for the Processor line in the System Information section, you will find the name and generation of your processor.

 The snapshot above shows that my system has a 12th-generation Intel Core i5-12500H processor.

 This information is important when troubleshooting and upgrading computer components. You can also compare performance differences between different Intel processor generations.

## 7\. How to Check Your Intel's Processor Generation Using Command Prompt

 If you're tech-savvy, you can also use Command Prompt to check your Intel processor generation. To do this, type **CMD** in the Windows search bar and select the Command Prompt app from the search results. If Command Prompt is new to you, here's a [quick tutorial on command line use](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-beginners-guide-to-the-windows-command-line/).

![Check Your Intel Processor Generation Using Command Prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/check-your-intel-processor-generation-using-command-prompt.jpg)

 In the Command Prompt window, type **wmic cpu get name**, and hit **Enter**. You will see your processor name along with its Intel processor generation.

## 8\. How to Check Your Intel's Processor Generation Using Windows PowerShell

 PowerShell is similar to Command Prompt but has additional features and functionality. So if you want a more advanced system report that includes your Intel processor generation, using PowerShell is the best option.

 To open PowerShell, right-click on the Start button and select **Terminal** from the options list. If it opens the Command Prompt instead, click the down arrow and select **Windows PowerShell** from the list. Alternatively, you can use the **Ctrl + Shift + 1** keys to open a PowerShell window directly.

![Check Your Intel Processor Generation Using PowerShell](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/check-your-intel-processor-generation-using-powershell.jpg)

 In the PowerShell window, type the following command, and hit **Enter**. You will get your processor name and Intel processor generation.

`Get-CimInstance Win32_Processor | Select Name`

 To find the total number of cores and threads in your processor, type the following command in the PowerShell window and hit **Enter**. You'll see the current core count for your CPU.

`(Get-CimInstance Win32_Processor).NumberOfCores`

 Similarly, type the following commands and hit Enter to get the total thread count.

`(Get-CimInstance Win32_Processor).NumberOfLogicalProcessors`

 These are some of the ways to check your Intel processor generation. Now you can use these tips before buying a new CPU or upgrading an old one to check Intel processor generation.

## Get to Know Your Intel Processor's Generation

 Hopefully, these methods helped you verify your Intel processor generation. Now you know what version your computer runs. If it's outdated, upgrading it can improve performance and stability. Just ensure your motherboard supports the processor.

 Below are the steps to easily check which Intel processor generation you have on Windows.
