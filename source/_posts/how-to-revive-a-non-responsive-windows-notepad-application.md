## How to Revive a Non-Responsive Windows Notepad Application

 Notepad is a simple text editor that has been part of the Windows operating system since its inception. Unfortunately, even after years of improvements and updates, Notepad is not immune to occasional crashes.

 If the Notepad app is constantly closing or crashing on your Windows 10 or 11 PC, don’t fret. Here are some tips that should help fix the problem.

## 1\. Resize the Notepad Window

 This may sound odd, but several users on [Microsoft Community](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/notepad-is-closing-automatically-windows-11-home/fc1a1f61-40ed-48ec-be84-1133a40e25dc) reported fixing Notepad crashes by simply resizing the app window.

 To resize the Notepad window, click the **Restore Down** button in the top right corner. Then, move your mouse cursor over the edge of the window and click and hold the left mouse button. Drag the window to the desired size and see if that resolves the issue.

 Note that this is just a temporary fix that you can use if you don’t have time to figure out what’s causing the problem. To resolve the underlying issue for good, it's time to dive into the potential root causes of this problem.

## 2\. Repair the Notepad App

 Both Windows 10 and 11 include a repair feature that can help fix problems with your apps and programs without affecting your data. You can try using this feature to repair the Notepad app and see if it resolves the abrupt crashes.

## 4\. Try Generic Fixes

 In most cases, one of the above suggestions should prevent Notepad from crashing on your Windows PC. If not, you can try some generic solutions to fix the problem.

* **Run an SFC scan:** Such app crashes on Windows can occur if some of the system files on your PC are damaged. You can [run the System File Checker scan on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/) to detect and repair any problematic system files on your PC.
* **Perform a clean boot:** A third-party app or service running in the background might be interfering with Notepad and causing it to freeze or crash repeatedly. To check for this possibility, you can [perform a clean boot on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-perform-clean-boot-windows-10/).
* **Install the latest Windows updates:** If you are experiencing similar app crashes with other apps as well, there may be an issue with the Windows build your PC is running. Try [installing pending Windows updates](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-manually/) and see if that fixes the problem.
* **Create another user account:** If nothing else works, your current user account may be at fault. In that case, you will have to [create a new user account on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-issues-creating-new-user-account/) to get Notepad working again.
