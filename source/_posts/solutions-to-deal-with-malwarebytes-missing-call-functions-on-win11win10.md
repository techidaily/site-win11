## 1\. Run the Program Install and Uninstall Troubleshooter

 Microsoft's Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter might be useful for fixing the Runtime Error since that's a software installation issue. This troubleshooter is designed to resolve problems that block users from installing or removing software.

 You can download and run the Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter like this:

1. Open Microsoft's download page for the[Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed-cca7d1b6-65a9-3d98-426b-e9f927e1eb4d) .
2. Select**Download troubleshooter** on that webpage.
3. To open that troubleshooter, press the**Windows** +**E** and bring up whatever folder contains its downloaded file. Then double-click the troubleshooter's**MicrosoftProgram\_Install\_and\_Uninstall.meta.diagcab** file.
4. Click**Next** to view two alternative troubleshooting options.

## 2\. Delete Malwarebytes' Certificates

1. Press**Windows** +**R** to[open the Run Dialog Box](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) .
2. Enter**certmgr.msc** inside Run's command text box.

6. Look for Malwarebytes' certificates in the**Untrusted Certificates** folder.
7. Right-click an untrusted Malwarebytes certificate and select**Delete** .
8. Click**Yes** to confirm the certificate's deletion.
9. Repeat the previous three steps to delete all the untrusted certificates associated with Malwarebytes you can find.
10. Exit the Certificate Manager tool.
11. Reboot your PC by clicking**Restart** on the Start menu.
12. Try installing the Malwarebytes software.

## 3\. Change the Temp Folder's Location

 Another issue that could cause the Runtime Error is when the Windows %TEMP% folder is not in its expected location. In this case, restoring that folder to its default location could solve the Runtime Error problem. To do so, set the %TEMP% folder's placement with some CMD commands as follows:

1. [Open the Command Prompt as an Administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/) .
2. Input this set Temp command and hit**Enter** :  
`set TEMP=C:\Windows\temp`

`sfc /scannow`  
![The SFC scannow command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-sfc-scannow-command.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Once you complete the scan, try installing Malwarebytes again to see if the issue is resolved.

## 6\. Run the CHKDSK Tool

 If you're still trying to resolve Runtime Error after applying resolutions one to five, run a CHKDSK scan to check the condition of your PC's hard drive. There could be an HDD or SSD error causing the installation issue on your PC. The CHKDSK (Check Disk) tool can repair any file system errors detected.

You can run a CHKDSK scan inside the Command Prompt like this:

1. Launch Command Prompt as an administrator.
2. Then type in and execute this Check Disk scan command:  
`chkdsk C: /f /r`
3. Press the**Y** button on your keyboard to schedule the Check Disk for a system restart.  
![The chkdsk command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-chkdsk-command.jpg)
4. Exit Command Prompt, and select Windows'**Restart** option.
