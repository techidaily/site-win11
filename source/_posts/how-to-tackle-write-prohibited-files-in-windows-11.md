## How to Tackle Write-Prohibited Files in Windows 11

 Installation errors are those that arise when users try to install certain desktop software packages. The “Error opening file for writing” error is one of the more common installation issues reported on support forums. Users who need to resolve that issue see an “Error opening file for writing” message pop up when they select to install programs within setup wizards.

 As a result, users can’t install Windows software packages for which that error occurs. Do you need to fix the same installation error? If yes, this is how you can resolve the “opening file for writing” error in Windows 10 and 11.

## 1\. Download the Setup File Again

 First, try downloading the software’s setup file a second time. This time select to download the file to a different folder. Also, make sure you’ve selected to download the right installation file for your PC if the software is available for different platforms and has alternative 32 and 64-bit versions.

## 2\. Run the Program’s Setup Wizard with Admin Rights

 This is a simple potential fix for the “opening file for writing” error that a lot of users have confirmed works. To apply it, click**File Explorer** (the taskbar button) and go to the folder that includes the setup wizard for the software you can’t install. Then right-click the software’s installer file and select**Run as administrator** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## 3\. Change a Standard User Account to Admin One

 The “opening file for writing” error will more likely occur in a non-admin account with limited permissions. If your user account is a standard one, change it to an administrator account with elevated permissions for installing software like this:

1. Open the Control Panel (see [how to open the Control Panel](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-control-panel/) for methods) and select**User Accounts** in that window.
2. Click the**Change your account type** option.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. Click the**Change Account Type** option to switch it to an admin account.

## 4\. Change the Installation Drive

 Some users have said they resolved this installation issue by selecting an alternative installation drive beyond C. So, that might be worth a try for users who’ve partitioned drives or have alternative external storage devices available. If you can select an alternative, click**Browse** in the setup wizard for the software to change the installation drive and choose a folder location there before selecting to install.

1. First, open the folder path in Explorer that includes the software setup file for which this error occurs.
2. Right-click the setup EXE file to view its context menu and select a**Properties** option.
3. Then click**Compatibility** on the window’s tab bar.
4. Next, press the**Run compatibility troubleshooter** button.

7. Then try installing the software again.

## 6\. Delete Temporary Files

 Another possibility is that corrupted temporary file data on your PC could be causing this installation issue. So, it’s recommended to eradicate temporary files. You can do that with the Disk Cleanup tool, Settings app, Command Prompt, or other methods outlined in our guide to [deleting temporary data on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-delete-temporary-files/) .

![The Temporary files checkbox in Disk Cleanup](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/temporary-files-checkbox.jpg)

## 7\. Change the Security Settings for the Installation File

 Sometimes an installation file’s security settings might need modifying to extend its permissions. To do that, you’ll need to add a new everyone user group and select**Full control** . You can change the security settings for the installation file with the following steps:

1. Simultaneously press**Win + E** to view File Explorer.
2. Bring up the directory the installation file you need to adjust settings for is in.
3. Click the setup file for the software with the right mouse button and select**Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 8\. Turn Off User Account Control

 User Account Control is a security feature in Windows that stops programs from making changes on a PC. That feature can sometimes cause installation issues when it’s set to high.

 Try temporarily turning off User Account Control with one of the methods in our guide to [disabling UAC on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-disable-user-account-control-prompt/) . Select to completely disable UAC and then attempt to install the software gain.

![The User Account Control Settings window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/user-account-control-settings.jpg)

## 9\. Disable Controlled Folder Access

 Controlled folder access is another security feature that can feasibly cause the “opening file for writing” error in Windows 10 and 11\. That feature blocks access and changes to its protected folders. This is how you can turn off controlled folder access if it’s enabled:

1. Open Windows Security by double-clicking a shield system tray icon that opens that app.
2. Next, click on the**Virus & threat protection** tab on Windows Security’s navigation sidebar.
3. Select the**Manage ransomware protection navigation** option to access a**Controlled folder access** setting.  
![The Controlled folder access setting](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/controlled-folder-access-option.jpg)
4. Click the**Controlled folder access** toggle switch to set that option to off.

## 10\. Uninstall the Old Version of the Software

 If you’re trying to install a new version of the software already on your PC, uninstall the existing (old) program version. You can uninstall software with the Programs and Features applet as instructed within our guide to [removing Windows software](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/) .

 However, it would be even better to uninstall the old program version with one of the [best third-party uninstaller utilities](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-uninstallers-stubborn-apps/) that thoroughly eradicate leftover files and registry entries.
