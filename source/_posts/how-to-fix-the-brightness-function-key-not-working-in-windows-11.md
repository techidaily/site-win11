## How to Fix the Brightness Function Key Not Working in Windows 11

 You may usually get eye strain or headaches when the brightness of your laptop or PC monitor is too low. Issues like this can be easily solved by adjusting the brightness with a simple press of the brightness function key.

 However, things get tricky if this key does not work anymore or has stopped functioning. In such cases, you may need to take a few steps in order to fix the brightness function key not working on Windows PC.

 After performing the above steps, restart your computer to reinstall the drivers. Once you power up again, check if the function key works now.

## 8\. Scan for Malicious Programs

 If you downloaded any suspicious file or program, then the chances are that your keyboard is experiencing interference due to malware, spyware, or other malicious programs.

 To make sure it isn't the case, you can [check if a file is infected with a virus or not](https://www.makeuseof.com/check-suspicious-file-malware/) . In case you find one, you need to [scan your computer for viruses and then remove them](https://www.makeuseof.com/scan-for-viruses-without-buying-antivirus-software/) .

 If you are more comfortable with command line tools, then [use Windows PowerShell to scan and remove any malicious components](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-powershell-to-scan-windows-10-for-malware/) from your system.

 This should help you fix the issue of your keyboard not functioning properly.

## 9\. Switch to a Different Keyboard

 Sometimes the problem is not others but the keyboard itself. It could have defective keys or some other hardware issue preventing it from functioning correctly; in that case, try using your device on another computer or laptop to be sure that the problem is not the operating system or software.

 If you find that your keyboard is the issue, then it’s time to replace it with a new one or get it repaired.
