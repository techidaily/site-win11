## Reconstructing the Windows Icon Database

 Windows maintains a cache database where it stores every icon image it displays. This way, Windows does not have to retrieve the icon file from the source repeatedly. As you might expect, this process helps Windows save valuable resources.

 It is not uncommon for this icon cache database to become corrupted over time. When this happens, Windows may fail to display icons correctly on your computer. Fortunately, you can fix such issues quite easily by rebuilding the icon cache on Windows.

 In this post, we'll explore a couple of different ways to rebuild the icon cache on Windows.

## How to Rebuild the Icon Cache on Windows Using File Explorer

 Windows saves all the icon cache data locally on your computer. You can use File Explorer to locate these cache files and delete them manually. This will effectively force Windows to rebuild the icon cache from scratch.

Follow these steps to delete icon cache files on Windows.

1. Press**Win + X** or right-click on the Start icon to open the Power User menu.
2. Select**Run** from the list.
3. Paste the following path in the Run dialog box and press**Enter** .  
`C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer`
4. In the File Explorer window that opens, you will find a series of icon cache files named**iconcache\_16.db** ,**iconcache\_32.db** ,**iconcache\_48.db** , and so on.
5. Press**Ctrl + A** to select all the cache files and click the trash icon at the top to delete them.

 It's important to note that some files will reappear shortly after you delete them as Windows attempts to rebuild the icon cache data. Additionally, a folder named**IconCacheToDelete** will appear in the same directory. It should go away automatically once you[restart File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-restart-file-explorer-windows-10/) or your computer.
