## WinEXE Enhancement: Convert Batch to Powerful Formats

 While both Batch and EXE files help you execute programs on your PC, you might find yourself in situations where you can run specific files only in the EXE format. For example, the EXE files can execute many more commands than the Batch files. Moreover, it's also pretty tidy when you can simply consolidate your scattered Batch files into a single, compact .exe format.

 In what follows, that's precisely what we're going to cover. We’ll look at the top two ways to convert your Batch files into an EXE format, and lay out the process for you.

## Convert Your Batch Files Into an EXE File

 Now, there are two broad ways to go about it. First, you can rely on a handy converter and let it convert your BAT files to EXE file. But, if you’re more of a do-it-yourself person, you can also go the manual way. Let’s dive into using the in-built Windows tool first.

![install program to launch](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/install-program-to-launch.JPG)

 In our example, we're converting a Batch file that contains a simple calculator. Therefore, in the command_cmd /c Calculator.bat_ , the name of our batch file is '_Calculator.bat_ '. Since your Batch file will be likely different, make sure you change the command accordingly.

 Stick with the default option in the**Show window** and**Finished message** menu, and click**Next** . Now, in the**Package Name and Options** menu, select**Browse** to pick a target path, name the file anything you’d like, and click on**Next** . In the following few pages, click on**Next** without changing anything.

 Finally, on the**Create package** page, click on**Next** again. That’s it, folks. Your EXE package will be created in a few minutes. All you’ve to do from there is to head to the destination folder and launch the file for verifying.
