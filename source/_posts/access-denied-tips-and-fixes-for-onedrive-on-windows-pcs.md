## 1\. Check Your Internet Connection

 Your device needs an active internet connection to stay connected to Microsoft’s servers. So, if you’re having trouble signing in to your Microsoft OneDrive account, check your internet connection. To do this, open the default web browser and load a page. If the page fails to load, your internet connection is likely the problem.

 If you're getting unreliable internet service, check out this guide on [fixing unstable internet connections](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-slow-unstable-wi-fi-connection/).

## 2\. Clear the OneDrive Cache

 Like any other application, OneDrive stores certain data locally to improve performance. If this data becomes corrupted, you may experience sign-in problems. In this case, clearing the OneDrive cache should help.

 To clear the OneDrive cache, do the following:

1. [Open File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) and navigate to the following:  
C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive
2. In the path above, replace **Username** with your user account name. If AppData isn't visible, make sure you enable **Hidden items** from the View ribbon.  
 Alternatively, open the command prompt with admin access, type **%localappdata%\\Microsoft\\OneDrive\\onedrive.exe /reset** in the text field. Then hit **Enter** on your keyboard. This will open the location where OneDrive stores its cache files.
3. Once you’re in the OneDrive folder, press **Ctrl + A** to select all items and hit the **Delete** key.

 Doing so will reset all OneDrive settings on your computer, including stored sign-in information.

## 3\. Unlink and Re-Link Your OneDrive Account

 If you have multiple OneDrive accounts, you should unlink your current account and relink it. This may help resolve account-related issues.

 To unlink OneDrive, do the following:

1. Go to the Taskbar and click the OneDrive icon in the system tray.
2. In the pop-up window, click the gear icon.
3. Select **Settings** from the options list.
4. From the Settings menu, click the **Account** tab.
5. Under your account, click **Unlink this PC**.
