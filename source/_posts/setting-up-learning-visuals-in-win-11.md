## Setting Up Learning Visuals in Win 11

 Are you looking to give your Windows PC a more educational feel? Education Themes are the perfect way to do just that! With these vibrant and engaging visuals, you can easily transform the look and feel of your computer into something that is more conducive to learning.

 In this article, we will show you how to enable Education Themes on Windows so that your PC looks great and supports educational activities.

## Do Windows Themes Affect Performance?

 The design of your computer can have a huge impact on how you approach work and play. A clean, organized desktop environment can help you stay focused and productive. So does this affect performance? In a way, yes.

 Themes do change the way your computer looks and works, but they don't actually slow it down like other programs. Instead, they're just a way to customize the look and feel of your computer without putting in any extra effort. In fact, some users find that changing up their theme helps to keep them more engaged with their work.

 However, certain themes may require more memory or processor power in order to run correctly than others. Therefore, if you are looking for maximum efficiency from your device, it would be wise to select a lighter-weight option such as the Education Themes offered by Windows.
