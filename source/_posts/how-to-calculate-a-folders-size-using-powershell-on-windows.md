## How to Calculate a Folder's Size Using PowerShell on Windows

 If you want to investigate which folders are taking up your storage space, you can check the folder's size to determine what's hogging your drive. Checking folder size is also helpful if you need to move a large folder to a USB drive or cloud storage. An easy way to do this on Windows is to use File Explorer and open the folder Properties dialog.

 File Explorer, however, can be slow to determine the size of a large folder. And not ideal if you want to manage files and folders on multiple computers in an organization. To remedy this, you can use PowerShell to quickly calculate folder sizes on Windows.
