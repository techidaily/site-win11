## Tips to Rectify Virtualbox's E_FAIL (Windows) Issue: 0X80004005

 VirtualBox is widely used open-source software that allows you to run multiple operating systems on your computer. Sometimes while using the program you may come across the error code E\_FAIL (0x80004005). This particular issue prevents you from accessing the software and generally occurs when launching any virtual machine.

 Fortunately, there are ways to tackle the issue and continue enjoying the various features of this versatile software.

## What Causes Error 0x80004005?

 VirtualBox E\_FAIL (0x80004005) errors can occur for a variety of reasons. It includes faulty settings in VirtualBox and incompatibilities with third-party applications. Additionally, improper Network Adapter configuration and incorrect configuration files may also cause this issue. The error generally appears after you install a new release of VirtualBox.

Let's now see how to fix this issue.

## 1\. Disable Hyper-V

 Hyper-V is a hardware virtualization technology from Microsoft that conflicts with VirtualBox, resulting in errors like this. To disable it, follow these steps:

1. Open Control Panel (see[how to open Control Panel](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-control-panel/) ) and select**Programs** .
2. In the**Programs and Features** section, click on**Turn Windows features on or off** .
3. Uncheck**Hyper-V** in Windows Features and click**OK** .

4. Next, press**Win + X** on your keyboard and select**Terminal (Admin)** .
5. If the User Account Control window appears, select**Yes** .
6. In the command prompt window, type this command and hit Enter:  
`bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off`

 Now close the window and restart your computer. After that, launch VirtualBox and check if the issue has been resolved.

## 2\. Install the Latest Version of VirtualBox

 Installing the latest version is the key to solving many issues and keeping your system glitch-free. Doing so will ensure that all software features and components are up-to-date and operating correctly.

To update your version, follow these steps:

3. Click on the link to download and follow the onscreen instructions to install the update.

 After you perform the installation process, try launching your virtual machine and see if the error has been fixed.

## 3\. Rename the VM XML File

 Another way to fix the issue is by renaming the VM XML file. This file includes important settings and configurations related to your virtual machine, which might cause the error. To rename it, follow these steps:

1. Open File Explorer (see[how to open File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) ) and navigate to the following directory:  
`C:\Users\username\VirtualBox VMs\`

 Upon doing so, a confirmation message pops up. Click**Yes** and relaunch the virtual machine. If the issue persists, move to the next solution.

## 4\. Uninstall Third-Party Applications

 Certain third-party applications like antivirus software or other security programs may interfere with VirtualBox and cause this error. Uninstalling them might help resolve the issue.

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Open Control Panel and select**Programs & Features** .
2. Locate the applications you want to remove and click**Uninstall** .

 After uninstalling the programs, restart your computer, and try running VirtualBox again.

## 5\. Try Reinstalling VirtualBox

1. Open Control Panel and go to**Programs & Features** .
2. Right-click on the VirtualBox entry and select**Uninstall** .
