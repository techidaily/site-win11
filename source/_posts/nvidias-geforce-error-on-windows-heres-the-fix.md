## 1\. Add the Game or App Manually

 The program relies on a[database of NVIDIA GeForce Experience-supported games](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/games/) for scanning. GeForce Experience can only optimize the games that are officially supported.

 When the app fails to find your currently installed game in its database, it returns a "Scanning Failed" error. Thankfully, you can manually add the game or app to GeForce Experience to resolve this.

Follow these steps to add a game or app for optimization manually:

1. Click the toggle next to your account name and select**Account** .  
![GeForce Experience Dashboard](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/geforce-experience-dashboard.jpg)
2. Click**GAMES & APPS > ADD** to open the Windows File Explorer.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Select the folder where you've installed the game or app and click**Select Folder** .  
![Game Folder Location](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/game-folder-location.jpg)
4. Click**SCAN NOW** to let GeForce Experience add your selected game to its dashboard.

 This is a simple and quick way to add your games to GeForce Experience manually. If this method doesn't work for you, consider the advanced solutions below.

## 2\. Restart the NVIDIA Service

 You can understand the GeForce Experience service as an essential process (or task) that helps the program to run correctly. When this service fails or gets disabled, you may not be able to use most of its features properly.

 To fix this, you can restart the services related to GeForce Experience. This will allow the related services to make a fresh start and solve any issue that may have been causing the error.

 Here are some steps to help you restart the GeForce Experience Service on Windows:

1. Press the**Win + R** key combination to open the**Run** dialog box.
2. Type**services.msc** in the dialog box and press**Enter** . This will open the Services app, where you can restart/enable/disable the services and do much more.
3. Locate the**NVIDIA Display Container LS** service in the list of services.
4. Right-click on it and select the**Restart** option from the context menu.  
![NVIDIA Display Container Service](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nvidia-display-container-service.jpg)
5. Do the same process, i.e., restart the service with**NVIDIA LocalSystem Container** and**Cryptographic** **Services** .  
![Cryptographic Windows Service](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cryptographic-windows-service.jpg)
6. Once done, make sure to restart your PC once.

 That's it. This will force all the required services to restart and fix runtime errors.

 Please note that restarting the Windows services is not the only fix! If you're still struggling to scan your game, move forward to try some advanced troubleshooting measures.

## 3\. Run GeForce Experience as an Administrator

 Running GeForce Experience as an administrator can help you fix scanning-related issues. Running an application in administrator mode allows a program to run with system-level permissions and access the necessary system resources without restrictions.

 Find the**GeForce Experience** shortcut on your desktop and right-click it. Click the**Run as administrator** option from the context menu to launch it as a power user.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Note that you've to exercise caution while running programs as an administrator. This could cause security issues if the program is affected by any malware.

 We never recommend running all programs in administrator mode! This is to avoid giving administrative privileges to programs that may misuse the permissions and affect your system.

## 4\. Repair Missing or Broken Registry Entries

 In some cases, missing registry entries can also cause GeForce Experience scanning to fail.

 If you've never heard of registry entries before, tweaking them can be quite risky. As a precautionary measure, we strongly advise[creating a restore point on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) before attempting any registry modifications. A restore point will come in handy if you want to revert the modifications you've made to the system.

 Now that you have a restore point set up, check out[how to fix broken Windows registry items](https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-broken-registry-items-windows-11/) . Remember to follow the provided guidance carefully and always double-check what you do to avoid any issues.

## 5\. Delete the NVIDIA AppData Folder

 On Windows, there is a folder called AppData that stores your specific data related to applications, such as settings, temporary files, and caches.

 If any Windows program is causing problems, then deleting its AppData folder may help you. This is because outdated or corrupted data within the folder can disrupt the regular operation of the application.

 Here's how you can delete NVIDIA's AppData folder on Windows:

1. Press the**Win + E** keyboard shortcut to bring up the Windows File Explorer.
2. Type**%LocalAppData%** on its navigation bar and press**Enter** .  
![LocalAppData Explorer Command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/localappdata-explorer-command.jpg)
3. Search for the**NVIDIA Corporation** folder and delete it. You can select**NVIDIA Corporation** and press**Shift + Del** to delete the folder permanently.  
![NVIDIA Corporation Folder](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nvidia-corporation-folder.jpg)
4. Once you delete the folder, open GeForce Experience and check for scanning issues.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 We advise you to be very careful while deleting files from the AppData folder. Deleting the wrong file can lead to other problems that may leave you in trouble.

## 6\. Reinstall GeForce Experience on Your Desktop

 No matter how big the Windows issue is, reinstalling the affected program works most of the time.

 You can try reinstalling GeForce Experience and check for the scanning issues thereon. Reinstalling the program will replace any damaged or missing files with a fresh copy, which can often resolve scanning issues.

 Here are the steps you need to follow to reinstall GeForce Experience:

1. Before reinstalling it, we advise you to uninstall GeForce Experience properly. You can use one of the ways to[uninstall software on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/) .
2. Go to the official[NVIDIA GeForce Experience](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/) website and click the**Download Now** button.
3. Double-click the installer file you just downloaded.
4. On the**NVIDIA Installer** window, click**AGREE AND INSTALL** .  
![NVIDIA Installer Overview](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nvidia-installer-overview.jpg)
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the program on your desktop.
6. Once the setup is over, you can click the three-dot menu and then**Scan for games & apps** . This will scan your entire Windows system for installed games or apps for optimization.  
![GeForce Experience Menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/geforce-experience-menu.jpg)

 If the scanning issue was related to the corrupted software files, this reinstallation process should resolve.

## Get Back to Scanning in GeForce Experience

 Fixing the scanning issue is undoubtedly crucial, as, without scanning, you can no longer optimize the games. And, when the games will remain unoptimized, there's no way you can experience that extra FPS in games.

 Hopefully, all the mentioned methods should help you regain the scanning feature in one go. Once you are ready for scanning, you will love its ease-of-optimization capabilities for sure.
