* Open **File Explorer** by clicking on its taskbar icon or use one of the [many ways to open File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/).
* Then, copy and paste this path into the File Explorer address bar:

 In this Assets folder, you'll probably see white thumbnails with long file names made of numbers and letters. These are not only the Spotlight images but also smaller image files and some that are not even images. So it's better if you sort them out first.

## How to Sort and Save Only the Spotlight Images

 Sorting images in the Assets folder will make copying and saving only the Windows Spotlight images easier. Here's how:

1. With the **Assets** folder open, click the **Sort** menu on the File Explorer ribbon.
2. Select **More** and then **Size**.  
![Sort Windows Spotlight Image Files By Size](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sort-spotlight-images-by-size.jpg)
3. The files will get sorted in ascending order. Change to descending order by clicking on **Size**.
4. You can copy all the files into the Assets folder. However, it will be easier if you select files that are over 300 kb—anything smaller will not be a Spotlight image.
5. Now right-click the selected files in the **Assets** folder and select the **Copy** option. When copying the files, you might get a warning message that these might be harmful to your computer. It's because these files are from a System folder and have no extension. Click **OK** to continue copying.

6. Create a folder on your PC from where you can easily access Windows Spotlight images to use as wallpapers. Name the folder **Windows Spotlight** or whatever you like.  
![Save Assets Files in Windows Spotlight Folder](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/save-assets-files-in-windows-spotlight-folder.jpg)
7. Right-click inside the folder you just made and select the **Paste** option or use the shortcut **Ctrl + V** to save the chosen Spotlight images from the **Assets** folder.

## How to Convert Spotlight Images to Picture Files

 Windows Spotlight images are now saved on your PC. However, you can't use them or even see what each image file looks like as they do not have any extensions.

 So you'll need to give them an image file extension and convert them to JPG image files. You can do that one by one. Add the **.jpg** extension after the long file name. It will get converted to a jpg file. You can then double-click the file to open and view it.

 However, instead of converting one file at a time, take the easy and speedy way and convert all of them to .jpg files. If you're on Windows 11, here's how. But if you're on Windows 10, scroll down to the next section.

1. Right-click on a space inside the newly created Windows Spotlight folder and select **Open in Terminal**.
