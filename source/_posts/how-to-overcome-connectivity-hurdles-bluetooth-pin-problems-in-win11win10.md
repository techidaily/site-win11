## How To Overcome Connectivity Hurdles: Bluetooth Pin Problems in Win11/Win10

 The “Check the PIN” error occurs for some users when they try pairing Bluetooth devices with their Windows 11/10 PCs. When users try connecting peripherals via Settings, the Add a device window shows this message, “Check the PIN and try connecting again.” Users say that issue typically occurs when they try to re-pair devices after unpairing them.

 The “Check the PIN” error means users can’t connect affected Bluetooth devices with their PCs. It is more widely reported to affect Bluetooth keyboards and headphones. You can fix the same issue on your PC with the potential “Check the PIN” fixes below.

## 1\. Run the Troubleshooter for Bluetooth

 Windows has a Bluetooth troubleshooter that can fix Bluetooth connectivity errors such as the “Check the PIN” Bluetooth error.

 You can find it listed among other troubleshooters within the Settings app. This [how-to-run Windows troubleshooters guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/run-troubleshooter-windows-10-11/) includes instructions for opening troubleshooting tools via Settings.

## 2\. Utilize the Add a Device Wizard

 The Add a device wizard provides another way to pair Bluetooth devices with your Windows PC. Some users have said they got around the “Check the PIN” error by pairing their Bluetooth devices with that wizard. This is how you can utilize the Add a device wizard in Windows 11/10:

1. Press **Windows** key + **S**, input **Control Panel**, and click the search result that matches the keyword entered.
2. Click **Large icons** on the Control Panel’s **View by** drop-down menu.

3. Then click **Devices and Printers** to view that applet.
4. Press the **Add a device** button.

5. Select your Bluetooth peripheral within the Add a device window. If you cannot see your Bluetooth device listed there, make sure it’s turned on and close enough to your PC to be discoverable.

6. Click **Next** to proceed with Bluetooth device pairing.
7. If prompted to input a WPS PIN, input the required device code in the text box.
8. Select **Next** to pair the Bluetooth device.

## 3\. Edit the Addrs Registry Key

 There’s also a confirmed registry tweak solution for the “Check the PIN error.” This tweak involves deleting a numeric subkey within the **Addrs** registry key. We advise you to back up the registry before attempting to apply possible fixes that involve deleting keys.

 Follow the below steps to edit the **Addrs** registry key:

1. To [open Registry Editor](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-registry-editor/), find that app by activating the Windows search box and inputting a **regedit** keyword. Then you can select **Registry Editor** in the search results.
2. Next, click inside the registry address box to clear the path there.
3. Input this **Addrs** registry key path in the address box:  
`HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Bluetooth\ExceptionDB\Addrs`
4. Double-click the **Addrs** key to expand it. If the **ExceptionDB** key doesn’t include an **Addrs** key in your registry, you can’t apply this potential solution.
5. Then right-click a numeric subkey within the **Addrs** key and select **Delete**. That subkey’s title will include random numbers and maybe letters also.

6. Click **Yes** when prompted to confirm the deletion.

## 4\. Update the Bluetooth Driver on Your PC

 Another possibility is that an old or faulty Bluetooth driver on your PC is causing the “Check the PIN” error. So, try updating your PC’s Bluetooth driver to see if that makes any difference. You can do that with the methods covered in this [guide to finding and replacing outdated drivers](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/find-replace-outdated-windows-drivers/).

 The most straightforward way to apply this resolution is to utilize a driver updater utility, such as Driver Booster 8\. That will show if the Bluetooth driver on your PC is outdated and provide you with an option to download and install a new one. We recommend utilizing one of the software packages from the [best free driver updaters for Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-best-free-driver-updaters/).
