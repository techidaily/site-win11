## Get a New View Every Day With Windows Spotlight

 As we just saw, you can enable or disable Windows spotlight images on the lock screen via the Settings app, Group Policy Editor, or Registry Editor. No matter which method you opt for, turning Windows spotlight images on or off should not take long.

 Since Windows stores all the spotlight images locally on your computer, you can even save them and use them as your desktop wallpaper if you want.
