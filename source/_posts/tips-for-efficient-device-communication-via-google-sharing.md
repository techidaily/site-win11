## Tips for Efficient Device Communication via Google Sharing

 Previously, you could only use Google's Nearby Share feature to share files between Android devices and Chromebooks. However, this has changed with Google's release of Nearby Share Beta for Windows. With it, you can seamlessly exchange photos, videos, documents, and more between Android phones and Windows PCs.

 Let's see how you can use Google’s Nearby Share app to transfer files between Android devices and Windows computers.

## Sharing Made Simple With Nearby Share on Android

 Sharing files between Android and Windows used to be a cumbersome process with no straightforward way to do it. Thankfully, all of that has changed with Google’s Nearby Share app for Windows.

 If you are looking for more functionality, however, you can use Microsoft’s Phone Link app to access your phone’s contacts, messages, call logs, photos, and more on your Windows PC.
