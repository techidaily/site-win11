## 5\. Turn Off Any Active Antivirus Apps

 Antivirus apps can sometimes interfere with the downloading and installing of legitimate apps. This can happen when an antivirus utility wrongly flags an app.

Then select to download/install the Microsoft Store apps for which error 0x80073CF3 occurs with the antivirus software deactivated.

 Windows also has a pre-installed antivirus tool. If you don’t have third-party antivirus software, you can try disabling the Microsoft Defender antivirus component.
