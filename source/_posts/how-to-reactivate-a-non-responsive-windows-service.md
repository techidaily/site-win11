## 1\. Run WSReset.exe as an Administrator

 WSReset.exe requires administrative privileges to run properly. If you're not running it as an administrator, it may fail to reset the Windows Store cache.

## 2\. Run the Windows Store App Troubleshooter

 This problem also appears due to corrupt system files or Windows Store application issues. To fix these issues, Windows offers an embedded troubleshooter that identifies and resolves problems with the Store app.

 To run the troubleshooter, use the steps below.

1. Press **Win + I** on your keyboard to open the Settings menu.
2. Select **System** from the left sidebar.
3. In the right pane, click **Troubleshoot > Other troubleshooters**.
