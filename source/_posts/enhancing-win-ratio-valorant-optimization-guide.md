## Enhancing Win Ratio: Valorant Optimization Guide

 Do you notice sudden drops in FPS when playing Valorant, or does it always remain low? There could be several reasons why this is happening: you might have adjusted your graphics quality too high, Valorant could be limiting your FPS, or third-party overlays or other apps could be stressing your hardware.

 Here's how to boost FPS in Valorant and keep it stable.

## 1\. Don't Let Valorant Limit Your Frame Rate

 Valorant comes with settings built into it that limit your FPS in various situations. These settings allow you to limit your FPS when the game is idle when you scroll through menus, when the game is minimized, or when you are using the laptop battery as the primary power source. You can also set it to limit your FPS at all times.

 You can allow Valorant to limit your FPS while you're in a menu and when it's idle, turned on, as you won't need high FPS when you're not actively playing the game. So, if they aren't already on, you should turn them on. In contrast, do not limit the FPS when running Valorant on battery power, and do not enable the option to keep it limited at all times.

 Here's how to configure these settings in Valorant:

1. Press **Escape** to open the Valorant settings.
2. Navigate to the **Video** tab at the top and open **General** settings.  
![Open General Settings in the Video Tab of Valorant](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2-open-general-settings-in-the-video-tab-of-valorant.jpg)
3. Turn off the options next to **Limit FPS on Battery** and **Limit FPS Always**. Also, increase the maximum frame rate.
4. Turn on the **Limit FPS in Menus** and **Limit FPS in Background** options.

## 2\. Change the Screen Resolution Settings in Valorant

 The higher the game resolution, the more pixels your graphics card will need to render, which can result in a noticeable drop in FPS. If you play Valorant with the highest resolution setting and get a low FPS, reducing the graphics quality will help you lower the strain on your GPU.

 To optimize graphics settings properly in Valorant, follow these steps:

1. Press **Escape** to open the Valorant settings.
2. Navigate to the **Video** tab at the top and select **Graphics Quality**.
3. Turn on **Multithreaded Rendering**.
4. Keep the **Material, Texture, Detail**, and **UI Quality** at a low or medium level.
5. Turn off the **Vignette** and **VSync** options.  
![Reduce the Resolution to Increase FPS in Valorant by Changing Settings in the Game](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/4a-reduce-the-resolution-to-increase-fps-in-valorant-by-changing-settings-in-the-game.jpg)
6. Set the **Anti-Aliasing** to **MSAA 4x**. Also, select **4x** in the **Anisotropic Filtering** menu.
7. Disable **Improve Clarity**, **Experimental Sharpening**, **Bloom**, **Distortion**, and **Cast Shadows**.

## 3\. Turn Off Hardware-Accelerated GPU Scheduling

 Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling transfers some CPU workload to your GPU. It enhances the performance of high-priority processes on your device. Although handy, this can put extra strain on your GPU and prevent it from using all its resources when playing Valorant, causing the frame rate to drop.

 To turn off this feature in Windows settings, check out [what hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling means and how to disable it](https://www.makeuseof.com/hardware-accelerated-gpu-scheduling-disable-windows/). If you follow the steps and discover that the hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling setting is already disabled, try turning it on and see if it improves or worsens your FPS.

## 4\. Turn Any Active In-Game Overlays Off

 Do you use in-game overlays with Valorant, such as the Discord overlay? While overlays can help you quickly open apps or chats, they also put more strain on your hardware. The additional load can reduce the GPU resources allocated to Valorant, causing the FPS to drop significantly.

 If you use any such overlay or keep more than one overlay enabled while playing Valorant, turn them off to see how much of an impact it has on your game's performance.

## 5\. Apply Some Windows-Specific Fixes

 If none of the fixes covered so far haven't helped boost your FPS on Valorant, don't fret. Try applying the following Windows-based tweaks and see if they help things:

1. [Turn off animation effects on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-turn-off-animation-effects/). This should help improve your performance, especially if you're using a lower-end PC.
2. Turn off the Xbox Game Bar to stop it from consuming resources. Open the **Settings** app, select the **Gaming** tab, click on **Xbox Game Bar**, and turn it off.  
![Disable the Xbox Game Bar Option in the Gaming Tab of the Windows Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/8-disable-the-xbox-game-bar-option-in-the-gaming-tab-of-the-windows-settings-app.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Enable Windows' Game Mode feature. This will automatically turn off background processes and apps as you play. You can even [use Windows Game Mode to prove the performance of any app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-game-mode-app-performance/), not just games. To do that, go to **Settings > Gaming > Game Mode** and enable it.  
![Enable Game Mode in the Gaming Tab of the Windows Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/9-enable-game-mode-in-the-gaming-tab-of-the-windows-settings-app.jpg)
4. [Update your graphics driver](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/) to the latest version. Also, [update your copy of Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-manually/) to take care of any minor glitches that might be causing the issue.
5. Boost the performance of Valorant by setting the **Graphics preference** settings to **High**. This ensures you're [using your preferred graphics card on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-choose-preferred-gpu/) when running Valorant.  
![Set Valorants Graphics Preference to High in the Graphics Settings of the Windows Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/10-set-valorants-graphics-preference-to-high-in-the-graphics-settings-of-the-windows-settings-app.jpg)
6. Set Valorant's process priority to high. To do that, open Task Manager, navigate to the **Details** tab, right-click the **Valorant** process, and select **High** from the **Set priority** menu.  
![Set Valorants Process Priority to High in the Windows Task Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/11-set-valorants-process-priority-to-high-in-the-windows-task-manager.jpg)

## 6\. Optimize Your Graphics Card Software

 If you've previously tweaked your GPU's software settings (for example, you [customized your graphics card settings using the NVIDIA Control Panel](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-customize-graphics-settings-nvidia-control-panel-geforce-experience/)), open the software again and turn down some of the settings. This is especially true if you told the GPU software to override any in-game settings you've set up.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 7\. Overclock Your GPU for Better Performance

 Similarly, you can [overclock your GPU](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/safely-overclock-gpu-gain-fps/) to get the best performance from your hardware. Try overclocking your GPU and see if it improves your FPS. Note, however, that overclocking the GPU can sometimes affect the game's performance negatively. If that happens, revert the change and turn off overclocking again.
