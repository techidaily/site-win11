## Uncovering Disk Identity: Windows-Based HDD/SSD Verification Guide

 Hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs) are the two most widely used storage drives. SSDs are faster, operate quietly, consume less power, and are more durable, whereas HDDs are less expensive, easy to repair, and provide more storage space at a lower price. Most modern devices come with SSDs, but some manufacturers still offer devices with HDDs to cater to specific audiences.

 If you have bought a new device and want to know if it has an HDD or SSD, here's how you can do that.

3. Navigate to the**Performance** tab, and you'll see the performance of the components of your device, including the**CPU** ,**Memory** ,**GPU** , and**Disks** .
4. Check details under**Disk 0** and**Disk 1** (if you have more than one connected) to confirm whether the disks installed are SSDs or HDDs.
