 After that, open the Task Manager and check the Desktop Window Manager GPU consumption.

## 5\. Disable HDR

 HDR, or High Dynamic Range, is a technology that uses your system's GPU to display a wider range of brightness and colors. However, enabling HDR on a weak GPU can do more harm than good.

 If you're experiencing compatibility issues or if apps and processes consume more GPU resources than you'd like, you should disable the HDR feature.

 To disable HDR in Windows 11, open Settings, select System from the left sidebar, and then select Display from the right pane. Then, disable the toggle switch next to **Use HDR**.

![Use HDR option in the Settings app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/use-hdr.jpg)

 After that, your display will momentarily go blank. Subsequently, you'll observe a shift in display color, indicating that you've successfully disabled HDR.

## 6\. Optimize Your Visual Effect Settings

 As aforementioned, the Desktop Window Manager oversees the visual aspects of your computer's interface. But, if your computer's visual effects settings are not correctly configured, the Desktop Window Manager might consume a significant amount of GPU resources.

 To resolve this, you must optimize your computer's visual effects settings. Here's how you can do it:

1. Press the **Win + R** hotkey to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type **sysdm.cpl ,3** into the search bar and press **Enter**.  
![Advanced system settings code in the Run dialog box](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/advanced-system-settings-code.jpg)
3. Under the Performance section, click on **Settings**.
4. Select the **Adjust for best performance** option.  
![Adjust for best performance option in Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/adjust-for-best-performance-option.jpg)
5. Click **Apply** and then **OK** to save the changes.

 Now, monitor your computer's GPU consumption. If it remains high, there's a possibility that corruption in important system files is causing the issue.

## 7\. Run an SFC Scan

 Itâ€™s common for Windows files to become corrupted due to malware attacks or sudden system crashes. Unfortunately, corruption in these system files not only results in data loss but also disrupts the regular functioning of your computer.

 While recovering the lost data might prove challenging, repairing the corrupt files to resolve ongoing system issues is relatively easy.

 SFC, or System File Checker, is a Windows built-in utility that looks for and repairs current system files. To run an SFC scan, open Command Prompt as an administrator (see how to [launch Command Prompt with administrative rights](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/)), type **sfc /scannow**, and press **Enter**.

![Sfc scan in Command Prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sfc-scan.jpg)
