## How to Show or Hide the Minimum or Maximum Processor State Using the Registry Editor

 You can also show or hide these options using the Registry Editor. However, before you do so, create a restore point as a backup in case you make a mistake and need to return your Windows computer to a previously-working state.

 After creating the system restore point, press**Win + R** to open the Run dialog box. Then, enter**regedit** in the text box and hit the**Enter** key to open the Registry Editor.
