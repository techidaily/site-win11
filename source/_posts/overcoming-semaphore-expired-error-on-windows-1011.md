### Change Your External Drive to NTFS Format

 Some Windows PC users have fixed error 0x80070079 by reformatting their external USB drives to the NTFS format.

 You can apply this possible resolution as covered within our guide to [reformatting USB drives in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-format-usb-drive-ntfs/).

 Reformatting a drive will wipe all the data on it. So, make sure you back up the drive’s data before reformatting if you want to keep any files on it.

### Reset Your Network

 This potential resolution is more applicable for users who encounter error 0x80070079 with network storage drives. Resetting your network will restore it to its settings to default and reinstall your PC’s network adapter. To apply this resolution, check out our [how to reset your network settings on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/reset-network-settings-windows-11/) guide.
