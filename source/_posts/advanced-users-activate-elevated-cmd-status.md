## Advanced Users: Activate Elevated CMD Status

 The Command Prompt is a text-based interface on Windows that allows you to issue commands to perform various tasks. People usually refer to it as a command line, shell, or even by its filename. And although the Command Prompt might not be as user-friendly as Windows' graphical user interface, it offers you more control over your system.

 Some commands, however, require administrator-level privileges to run properly. As such, here are some quick and easy ways to open Command Prompt as an administrator in Windows.

## 1\. How To Run Command Prompt as an Administrator Through the Windows Search Tool

 To run Command Prompt as an administrator, you can use the Windows Search feature. Here's how to do it:

1. Press **Win + Q** on your keyboard to open Windows Search.
2. Type "Command Prompt" into the search box.
3. Select **Run as administrator** from the right pane.

4. You may be prompted to confirm your identity; in that case, click **Yes**.

 Once you've done that, Command Prompt will open with administrative privileges. From there, you can enter any commands you like; just keep in mind that they will have full system access, so use them wisely!

## 2\. How to Run Command Prompt as an Administrator Using the Run Dialog

 If you need to run Command Prompt as an administrator in Windows 11, you can do so by using the Run dialog box. The steps are as follows:

 If you need to close Command Prompt, simply type “exit” and press Enter on your keyboard. This will close the program and return you to the desktop.

## 3\. How to Run Command Prompt as an Administrator via the Quick Access Menu
