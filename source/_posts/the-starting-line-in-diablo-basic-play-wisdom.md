## The Starting Line in Diablo: Basic Play Wisdom

 With Diablo IV's June 6 launch, the franchise is once again in the limelight. The original Diablo was quite the spectacle when it launched back in 1996 and has gained somewhat of a cult following since then. With the franchise now consisting of four core games in total, there's never been a better time to revisit the original.

 But how do you play the original game 27 years after its launch, especially when Blizzard doesn't sell it anymore? Let's find out.

## Why Doesn't Blizzard Sell Diablo Anymore?

 Other than the fact that it's a really old game and Blizzard already maintains just about every other Diablo game already, the publisher has partnered with GOG to preserve Diablo in its original form (bar some compatibility fixes and HD resolution support).

![A screenshot of a large battle between heroes and demons](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_20220613_074954-1.jpg)

 While Blizzard's announcement of the partnership via a [2019 Blizzard.net post](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo3/22887361/diablo-now-available-on-gog-com) didn't state why Blizzard won't be selling one of its most popular games ever, it presumably is to ensure that the game gets the attention it deserves, especially considering just how full Blizzard's plate is with the rest of the Diablo franchise, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch 2\.

## How to Play the Original Diablo

 At the time of writing, there are two main ways you can play the original Diablo on a PC. You can either download the official copy from GOG, or you can take a chance on an open-source port of the game which does come with its own caveats.

### Play Diablo Using GOG

 As mentioned before, since the Blizzard-GOG partnership the best way of playing Diablo is by buying the game via GOG. It's available in two versions from the [GOG site exclusively](https://www.gog.com/en/game/diablo) for $9.99\.

* **Original version:** This is the unchanged version of the game that's compatible with Battle.net allowing players to connect to one another.
* **GOG-enhanced version:** This version brings quality-of-life improvements including but not limited to compatibility fixes, upscaling support for resolution and refresh rate, as well as minor audio fixes at the cost of online multiplayer. This version only supports multiplayer via LAN or P2P connections.

 Do keep in mind that this is a DRM-free version of the game that's compatible with Windows 10 and 11 out of the box. You don't need to install GOG Galaxy to play the game either, although that does make managing GOG-sourced game installations easier. Additionally, while Diablo: Hellfire isn't exactly a Blizzard product, considering its popularity, it's included in the purchase as a free add-on as well.

### Play Diablo Using an Open-Source Diablo Port

 Another way you can play Diablo is by using an open-source port of the game called [DevilutionX (GitHub)](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX) (scrolling down gives instructions). The port makes it simple to run the game while also bringing engine improvements, bug fixes, and other optional quality-of-life improvements.

 That said, while this method is free, it does come with a major caveat â€” you need the original game files in order to run the port. These files can either be found on the original game CD or in the aforementioned GOG release. This is very similar to [playing Diablo in your browser](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/play-original-diablo-browser/) as both methods require the DIABDAT.MPQ file.

![Screenshot showing the DevilutionX Github repository.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/diablo-port.jpg)

 As far as multiplayer gameplay is concerned, DevilutionX uses its own multiplayer system based on ZeroTier that allows players to host public or private games on the internet. The approach is simpler as compared to playing on Battle.Net, at least on paper, but Battle.Net servers are still going to be more reliable and secure.

 Of course, since this is a third-party mod of the original Diablo, you can't play directly on Battle.Net servers. This makes ZeroTier, direct IP connections, and LAN gameplay your only options.

 There are some advantages to using an open-source port though. You get far better mod support with a slew of mods and related projects being built by the community, there's better multi-language support compared to the "official" GOG version which is only available in English, controller support, and last but not least, multi-platform support.

 Both options give you the chance to experience a legendary title in a day and age where the hardware that it was designed for has far been obsolete. However, we also have a [list of action RPG games you can play instead of Diablo](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-action-rpg-games-to-play-instead-of-diablo/), just in case.

## Is the Original Diablo Playable on Modern Consoles?

 Unfortunately, the original Diablo is yet to make its console debut. However, Blizzard has been known to release older games on newer generation consoles from time to time, a prominent example being Diablo 2: Resurrected.

 So even though the original Diablo isn't available to play on your Xbox Series X|S or PS5, there's a possibility (albeit a small one) that Blizzard might end up launching a digital re-release for consoles.

## Old Games Can Be Quite the Experience

 If you're a fan of retro games or a new gamer looking to experience some of the classics, there's no shortage of websites, emulators, and open-source projects that will let you experience the retro era of gaming. Sure the eight-bit graphics aren't comparable to modern ray-traced games by a long shot, but they do have their own charm.

 But how do you play the original game 27 years after its launch, especially when Blizzard doesn't sell it anymore? Let's find out.
