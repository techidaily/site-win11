## Maximizing Window Image Display: Windows 11 Style

 Most of us are in front of our PC screens for a long time nowadays. And a stunning desktop wallpaper can personalize your workspace while making things brighter. But when you download a JPEG wallpaper or use a personal image as your desktop background, Windows automatically reduces its quality to save memory and improve system performance.

 However, if your PC has powerful hardware and specifications, you needn't worry about the system being impacted. You can enjoy your favorite wallpapers at their highest resolution, especially if you use a full HD, 2K, or 4K monitor. Let's explore how.

## How to Set the Highest Wallpaper Quality via the Registry Editor

 Windows 11 compresses your JPEG wallpaper images to 85% before setting them as your desktop background. There's no setting you can apply to prevent Windows from doing this. However, you can stop this quality reduction by editing the Windows registry. We recommend [creating a system restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/)before tweaking the registry to restore Windows to its previous good state if things go wrong.

 Now let's see how you can edit the registry to set the highest wallpaper quality.

1. Type **Registry Editor** in Windows Search and click on **Registry Editor** under **Best match**.
2. Click **Yes** on the UAC prompt.
3. In the Registry Editor, use the following path to reach the Desktop folder: **Computer\\HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Control Panel\\Desktop**

4. On the right pane of the Desktop folder, right-click a blank area and select **New**. Then, select **DWORD (32-bit) Value**.

5. Name this newly created value as **JPEGImportQuality,** writing it just like this. Then, click **enter** to save the value.
6. Double-click on the **JPEGImportQuality** value to edit it. Under **Value Data**, put **100,** which represents 100% JPEG image quality without any compression. Remember, when you set the Value Data as 100, the **Base** should be selected as **Hexadecimal**. Then click **OK**.

7. Finally, close the Registry Editor and restart your PC.

 Now you can view and enjoy your favorite wallpapers at their highest 100% quality. You'll notice this difference in resolution, picture quality, and clarity much better on a bigger, high-resolution screen.

 Remember, Windows 11 reduces the picture quality of JPEG images only. Other image files like PNG are not affected by this quality reduction.

 However, if your PC has powerful hardware and specifications, you needn't worry about the system being impacted. You can enjoy your favorite wallpapers at their highest resolution, especially if you use a full HD, 2K, or 4K monitor. Let's explore how.
