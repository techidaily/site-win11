## Understanding the Problem Behind Error Code 0x80004004

 The Microsoft Defender error code 0x80004004 occurs when there is an issue with the tool’s functionality, such as when launching the app, trying to update it, or during a scan. When this error occurs, it can cause the following problems:

* You might not be able to perform a scan using Microsoft Defender. This can happen when you are either trying to initiate a manual scan or scheduling one for later.
* The error may prevent you from updating the Defender utility. If this happens, you are likely to face the error statement "Virus and spyware definitions couldn’t be updated", which can leave your system vulnerable to threats.
* The real-time protection feature which monitors the files and processes to protect your system might fail to function.

 There can be a number of reasons why this error might be occurring on your system. Here are some of the most common ones:

* **Interference from other antivirus software** \- if you have installed another third-party security program on the system, it might be interfering with the processes of Microsoft Defender, leading to the problem.
* **Outdated Defender components** \- the critical components of Microsoft Defender which are essential for it to function might be outdated or corrupt, preventing it from functioning properly.
* **Malware infection** \- the system may be dealing with malware that is interfering with the Defender’s functionality.
* **Essential services are disabled** \- the services Microsoft Defender relies on to function might be disabled or corrupt. These services can vary depending on the version of Windows you are using.
* **Corrupted or missing system files** \- the critical system files required for the Microsoft Defender can at times become corrupt or go missing, causing different issues within the system, including the one under discussion.

 Regardless of what might be causing the problem in your case, the solutions we have discussed below are sure to help you fix the problem. Proceed with them one by one to fix the problem once and for all.

## 1\. Restart the Microsoft Defender Services

 The first thing that we recommend doing is restarting the services that Microsoft Defender relies on to function properly. It's possible that these services may have been disabled by another user or malware on the system, or they may have encountered corruption errors, leading to the problem. Restarting these services can help resolve such issues and get Microsoft Defender back on track.

Here is how you can do that:

1. Press the**Win + R** keys together to open the Run dialog.
2. Type "services.msc" in Run and click Enter.
3. In the Services window, locate Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection and right-click on it.
4. Choose**Properties** from the context menu.

5. Now, click on the**Start** button if the service is stopped. If it is functional, click on the**Stop** button, wait for a few seconds, and click**Start** .
6. Make sure the Startup type is set to**Automatic** .
7. Click**Apply** \>**OK** to save the changes.

 Perform the same steps for the Microsoft Defender Firewall service and check if the issue is resolved.

## 2\. Uninstall Conflicting Software

 As we mentioned above, the issue can also occur if you have another third-party security program installed on the system. It might be interfering with the process of Microsoft Defender, leading to the issue.

 If you have a different program offering the same functionalities installed, then we recommend uninstalling it and checking if that makes any difference. Our guide on[removing software from Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/) should help you perform the steps with ease.

 If you do not want to uninstall the program just yet, you can also disable it temporarily and try performing the action that was initially leading to the Defender error. To disable such programs, you can right-click on their icon in the taskbar and choose**Disable until the computer is restarted** .
