## Understanding the Problem Behind Error Code 0x80004004

 The Microsoft Defender error code 0x80004004 occurs when there is an issue with the tool’s functionality, such as when launching the app, trying to update it, or during a scan. When this error occurs, it can cause the following problems:

* You might not be able to perform a scan using Microsoft Defender. This can happen when you are either trying to initiate a manual scan or scheduling one for later.

## 1\. Restart the Microsoft Defender Services

 The first thing that we recommend doing is restarting the services that Microsoft Defender relies on to function properly. It's possible that these services may have been disabled by another user or malware on the system, or they may have encountered corruption errors, leading to the problem. Restarting these services can help resolve such issues and get Microsoft Defender back on track.

Here is how you can do that:

1. Press the**Win + R** keys together to open the Run dialog.
2. Type "services.msc" in Run and click Enter.
3. In the Services window, locate Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection and right-click on it.
4. Choose**Properties** from the context menu.

5. Now, click on the**Start** button if the service is stopped. If it is functional, click on the**Stop** button, wait for a few seconds, and click**Start** .

## 2\. Uninstall Conflicting Software

 As we mentioned above, the issue can also occur if you have another third-party security program installed on the system. It might be interfering with the process of Microsoft Defender, leading to the issue.

 If you have a different program offering the same functionalities installed, then we recommend uninstalling it and checking if that makes any difference. Our guide on[removing software from Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/) should help you perform the steps with ease.

 If you do not want to uninstall the program just yet, you can also disable it temporarily and try performing the action that was initially leading to the Defender error. To disable such programs, you can right-click on their icon in the taskbar and choose**Disable until the computer is restarted** .
