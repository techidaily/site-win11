## Transitioning to Windows 11 Without Interruption: The In-Place Approach

 Microsoft offers the option to repair or reset your Windows PC from Windows 8 onwards. Before that, you needed an installation media (DVD or USB) to format your system. But what if you don’t want to create an installation media and wipe out everything on your system just to upgrade to a newer Windows version? Well, that’s where Microsoft’s in-place upgrade can help you.

 We will elaborate on what exactly is an in-place upgrade and how it differs from a clean installation of Windows 11\. Moreover, you will learn about the detailed method to perform the upgrade if the need arises.

## What Is an In-Place Upgrade on Windows?

 An in-place upgrade helps you replace your current Windows installation files with a new copy without removing anything else on your system. So, you can use this feature to upgrade to a new version of windows or fix your current installation.

 All of this is made possible by the latest Windows ISO file. You can perform an in-place upgrade or wipe out everything and start with a clean slate. But why do an in-place upgrade when you can[Reset your PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/reset-windows-11-settings-app/) and keep all your personal files? It is because of the difference between the two methods.

 An in-place upgrade doesn’t replace anything other than Windows files. So, in addition to your personal files, all the installed apps and system settings also remain untouched. You won’t need to re-configure those settings after the in-place upgrade completes. But if you go with the Reset option, it can preserve your files but will remove all your installed programs and settings.

## The Prerequisites Before Performing a Windows In-Place Upgrade

 You will need to do the following things before performing an in-place upgrade:

* [Turn off Windows Defender](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-turn-off-windows-defender/) completely (or any other third-party antivirus you have installed).
* [Disable BitLocker encryption](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-disable-or-suspend-bitlocker/) on your disk.
* Sign in with an administrator account.
* Remove all external peripherals.
* Ensure fast internet connectivity.
