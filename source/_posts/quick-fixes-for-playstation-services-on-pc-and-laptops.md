## Quick Fixes for PlayStation Services on PC & Laptops

 The Xbox Game Pass is a popular Microsoft subscription service for games. However, some users encounter a 0x800700e9 error when they try to download and install Xbox Game Pass titles via the Xbox app or Microsoft Store. The 0x800700e9 error code message says “Something unexpected happened,” which provides no clue as to how to resolve that issue.

 Users can’t download and install Xbox Game Pass content because of error 0x800700e9\. However, you can fix error 0x800700e9 with these potential resolutions.

## 1\. Run the Microsoft Store App Troubleshooter

 The Windows Store App troubleshooter might help fix the error 0x800700e9\. This is how you can access the Windows Store App troubleshooter in Windows 11:

1. Use one of the many[ways to launch the Settings app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) .
2. Click the**Troubleshoot** box that has a spanner icon.
3. Next, click**Other-troubleshooters** to access the Settings app’s list of troubleshooting tools.
4. Select**Run** for activating the Windows Store Apps.

5. Apply any suggestions the troubleshooter provides.

 The Windows 10 troubleshooters are available within the**Update & Security** category of Settings. Click the**Troubleshoot** tab in that category and select**Additional troubleshooters** . Then you can select Windows Store Apps from there and click**Run** to access the tool.

## 2\. Turn Delivery Optimization On in Settings

 Delivery Optimization is a service that enables Windows Update downloads from other PCs. Error 0x800700e9 often arises when Delivery Optimization is disabled in Windows. You can turn on Delivery Optimization via Settings like this:

1. Open the**Windows Update** tab in Settings.
2. Click**Advanced options** to view more settings.
3. Select the**Delivery Optimization** navigation option.

5. Click the**Devices on my local network** radio button.

 You can enable Delivery Optimization in Windows 10’s Settings app much the same. However, you’ll need to select the**Windows Update** category. Then click the**Deliver Optimization** tab in the**Windows Update** category to access and turn on the same**Allow downloads from other PCs** setting.

## 3\. Enable the Delivery Optimization and BITS Services

 Some Xbox Game Pass users have resolved error 0x800700e9 by enabling and running the Delivery Optimization and BITS services. You can enable and start those services via that app as follows:

1. To access Run, press**Win + R** .
2. Type**services.msc** inside Run’s**Open** command box.
3. Select**OK** to open Services.

## 4\. Enable Delivery Optimization via the Windows Registry

 If the above methods didn't work for you, try enabling Delivery Optimization service by editing the registry. You can back up the registry or set up a restore point before editing the registry if you want to be extra careful. To apply this potential solution, edit the**DoSvc** key like this:

3. Input this**DoSvc** key location in the address bar and hit**Return** :  
`Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DoSvc`  
![The DoSvc key](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dovsc-key.jpg)

![The Modify option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/modify-option.jpg)
5. Input**3** in the**Value** box and click**OK** .  
![The Edit DWORD window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/start-dword-key.jpg)
6. Exit Regedit, and restart the PC.

## 7\. Reinstall the Microsoft Store

2. Right-click PowerShell to bring up a context menu, and select the**Run as administrator** option.

## 8\. Reset Your Network

![The Network reset option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/network-reset-option.jpg)
