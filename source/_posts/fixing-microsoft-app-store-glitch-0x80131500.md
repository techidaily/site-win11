## 2\. Restart Your System

 If terminating the Microsoft Store app didn’t do any good, you must restart your system. Restarting is the oldest trick in the book which clears the memory and restarts all the essential services and programs. Press the Win key and click on the Power icon. Then select the Restart option.
