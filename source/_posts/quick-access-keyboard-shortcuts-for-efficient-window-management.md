## Quick Access: Keyboard Shortcuts for Efficient Window Management

 By default, the taskbar is the only place you can minimize software windows within Windows 10 and 11\. Neither Windows 11 nor 10 has any built-in feature that enables users to minimize windows to the system tray area.

 However, some third-party software packages enable you to minimize windows to the system tray with hotkeys. This is how you can minimize software to the Windows system tray area with keyboard shortcuts.

## How to Minimize Windows to the System Tray With Traymond

 Traymond is a very basic app for Windows that enables you to minimize windows to the system tray with a non-configurable keyboard shortcut. This software doesn’t have any user interface. However, it still works quite well for what it’s designed to do. You can minimize software windows to the system tray with Traymond like this:

1. Bring up this [Traymond page](https://github.com/fcFn/traymond/releases).
2. Click the **Traymond.exe** download link.  
![The Traymond.exe download link](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/traymond-exe-download-link.jpg)
3. Double-click the **Traymond.exe** file to run the app.
4. Then press the **Win** \+ **Shift** \+ **Z** hotkey to minimize a File Explorer window to the system tray area.

 Now you’ll see an icon for the minimized File Explorer window in the system tray area. You can double-click any window minimized to the system tray to view its window again. Or right-click the Traymond system tray icon to select Restore all windows.

![The context menufor MinimizetoTray](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/minimizetotray-context-menu.jpg)

 Note that Traymond doesn’t minimize UWP apps to the system tray area. This means the software’s hotkey doesn’t work for any Microsoft Store apps.

## How to Minimize Windows to the System Tray With MinimizeToTray

 MinimizeToTray is another lightweight, relatively simple program that enables you to minimize active software in the system tray area. However, this program also offers settings to customize its hotkeys and works for UWP apps and desktop software.

 This is how you can send software to the Windows system tray with MinimizeToTray:

1. Open this [MinimizeToTray download page](https://github.com/sandwichdoge/MinimizeToTray/releases/).
2. Extract the MinimizeToTray ZIP archive to a folder. This [how-to unzip ZIP files guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-extract-zip-files-windows-11/) includes instructions for extracting ZIP archives on a Windows 11 PC.  
![The Extract all option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/extract-all-option5.jpg)
3. Double-click **MinimizeToTray** in the software’s extracted folder.
4. Open a window to try out the MinimizeToTray hotkey.
5. Press **Alt** \+ **F1** to minimize the active software window to the system tray.

 You won’t see any icons for windows minimized within the system tray area. However, the MinimizeToTray menu includes all software minimized to the tray area with the **Alt** \+ **F1** hotkey. You can restore a minimized window by right-clicking the MinimizeToTray system tray icon and selecting a minimized window shown on its context menu. Alternatively, you can press **Alt** \+ **F2** to restore the last active window.

![The context menufor MinimizetoTray](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/minimizetotray-context-menu.jpg)

 If you want to change the MinimizeToTray hotkeys, select **Configs** on its context menu. That will bring up a window on which you can set the keyboard shortcuts for minimizing and restoring windows. Click inside a hotkey box and press some keys to set a different keyboard shortcut. Select **OK** in the Edit Hotkeys window to save your new keyboard shortcuts.

 You can reconfigure those keyboard shortcuts from the 4t Tray Minimizer’s settings window. Click **View** and **Options** to bring up that settings window. Select the **Keyboard** tab to view the default hotkeys. Double-click a hotkey there to bring up a **Change Key Sequence** window that includes settings for changing hotkeys. Select the alternative key combination there and click **OK**.

 4t Tray Minimizer also adds five new title bar options to software windows. To access them, right-click a window’s title bar to view its context menu. Then you can select **Minimize to tray**, **Roll up**, **Stay on top**, and **Make transparent** options on the context menu. There’s also a 4t Tray Minimizer submenu from which you can select to add the active window to the exclusion list.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 The hotkeys for those title bar options are disabled by default. However, you can enable them by selecting the **Show disabled** hotkeys checkbox on the **Keyboard** tab. Select the checkboxes for the active window hotkeys to enable those keyboard shortcuts.
