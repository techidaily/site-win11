## 1\. How to Fix "This App Will Not Work on Your Device"

 Sometimes, the Microsoft Store will explicitly state that the app won't work on your PC. However, there are ways to fix this without upgrading your PC. Check out [how to fix "this app will not work on your device"](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-this-app-will-not-work-on-your-device-error-in-windows/) for more information.

## 2\. Download the App From Its Website

 If you don’t have the time to figure out what’s wrong with Microsoft Store, there’s a quick workaround for you to try. Check if you can download the app through the developer's website.

 If the app is available, download the installer and run it on your computer to get the app. If you choose to do so, check your Windows version to ensure you’re downloading the right app version.

 When looking for an app online, don’t download it from an unreliable website to avoid infecting your computer with malware. Instead, go through the below solutions to fix the incompatibility error.

## 3\. Run the Windows Store Apps Troubleshooter

 Fortunately, Windows comes with plenty of built-in tools to help you diagnose and fix system malfunctions. The same goes for the store, as you should run the Windows Store Apps to fix any store glitches.

1. Right-click the **Start** button and select **Settings**.
2. Go to **System > Troubleshoot > Other troubleshooters**.
3. From the **Other** section, click the **Run** button next to **Windows Store Apps**.

## 4\. Update the Microsoft Store

 Microsoft Store might throw error when installing a new app if it’s outdated. In this case, updating the Store to the latest version should fix the problem.

 Launch the Store and click **Library**. Then, you can look for the Microsoft Store in the list and update it individually. But to make things easier and prevent future issues with other apps, click the **Get updates** button.

![Update Microsoft Store](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/update-microsoft-store-1.jpg)

 This way, you install any pending updates for the apps installed through Microsoft Store.

## 4\. Run an SFC and DISM Scan

![Run SFC scan in Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sfc-scan-1-1.jpg)

 If Microsoft Store still can't install an app after updating it, you might be dealing with corrupted system files. In this case, you should launch Command Prompt with administrative rights and run an SFC and DISM scan.

## 5\. Turn On Necessary Features

 Depending on the app’s functionality, it might need a certain feature enabled on your computer. For example, the Virtualization Manager app requires the Virtual Machine Platform feature to be enabled.

 You can check the app description to find out if it needs a specific feature, so it runs properly. Then, head to Settings and [enable Windows 11 optional features](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-add-remove-optional-features-windows-11/).

## 6\. Restart the Application Identity Service

 Windows has a built-in service that checks an app's identity when running it. If there’s something wrong with the Application Identity service, you might run into Windows's inability to run a certain app. In this case, you should restart the Application Identity services.

 In the Start menu search bar, search for **services** and select **Run as administrator**. Then, locate and open **Application Identity**. Click **Stop > Start** to restart the service.

![Restart the Application Identity service](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/restart-identity-service-1.jpg)

 Close Windows Services, reboot your computer and try to run the problematic app again.
