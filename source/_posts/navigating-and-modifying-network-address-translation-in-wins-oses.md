## Navigating and Modifying Network Address Translation in Wins OSes

### Key Takeaways

* Changing the NAT type from strict to open can improve network connectivity and reduce network-related issues when playing multiplayer games online.
* You can change your NAT type on Windows by enabling Discovery Mode, UPnP, or port forwarding.
* Port forwarding provides greater control over open ports and enhances security compared to UPnP, but it requires knowing the specific TCP and UDP ports used by your game.

 You may want to change your NAT type from strict to open when playing multiplayer games online. A strict or moderate NAT type may cause network problems when joining a game party, like abrupt disconnections, lags, and making it difficult to host matches.

 You can change the NAT type on Windows to ease restrictions, resulting in a faster and more reliable network connection. But you must balance your needs with potential security risks when changing the NAT.

## What Is NAT, and What Are the NAT Types?

[Network Address Translation](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-network-address-translation-nat-and-how-does-it-work/) (NAT) is a feature in routers (and firewalls) that translates the private IPv4 address from devices in your home and office to the public IPv4 address assigned to your router by the ISP and vice versa. NAT helps address the limited number of public IPv4 addresses available worldwide.

 A NAT type describes the status of your network connection. The three NAT types are Strict, Moderate, and Open.

* **NAT Type Strict:** It is the most secure of the NAT types but also the most restrictive one. Users with a Strict NAT type can join games hosted by a system with an Open NAT type. However, the connection is dropped if a system with a Moderate NAT type joins the same game.
* **NAT Type Moderate**: It is moderately secure and opens a few ports. Systems with a Moderate NAT type can join other systems using the Moderate or Open NAT type.
* **NAT Type Open**: Choose Open NAT if you want to host matches. It has no restrictions and facilitates data transfer between all devices without restrictions, irrespective of their NAT type or firewall configuration.

 Your default NAT type depends on your router configuration. If you experience network-related issues, changing your NAT type from Strict or Moderate to Open can help. However, be wary of potential security risks associated with changing your NAT type to Open.

## How to Set a Static Private IP Address

 Whether you want to change the NAT type using the UPnP method or port forwarding, you'll need a static IP address to make it work. Since most routers assign a dynamic IP address, you must manually configure a static IP for your Windows device.

 If you already have a static IP address assigned to your device, skip to the following steps to change the NAT type. If not, follow the below steps to [set a static IP address on your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/static-ip-address-windows-pc/):

1. Press **Win + R** to open **Run**.
2. Type **cmd** and click **OK** to open **Command Prompt**.
3. In Command Prompt, type the following command to view your network information:  
`ipconfig`
4. For this guide, we'll set up a static IP for the Ethernet adapter. So, scroll down to the **Ethernet adapter** section and note down the **IPv4 Address**, **Subnet Mask**, and **Default Gateway**.

## 2\. Enable UPnP On Your Router

![TP-Link Router Web Interface with UPnP Enabled](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/enable-upnp-tp-link-router.jpg)

 You can change your NAT type to Open by enabling Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) in your router settings. This is the easiest way to change the NAT type, provided you can access your router configuration page. However, there are [security concerns with the UPnP method](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-upnp-and-why-is-it-dangerous-makeuseof-explains/), which hackers may exploit.

 Note that the following steps apply to a TP-Link router. The process to enable UPnP may differ for routers from other manufacturers. Check your router's user manual or manufacturer knowledge base online for instructions.

 Follow these steps to enable UPnP:

1. Log in to your router's web-based utility. To do this, type the default gateway address (for example (<http://192.168.0.1>) in the search bar and press Enter. If not, here's [how to find your router's IP address](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/find-routers-ip-address/).
2. On the router dashboard, open the **Advanced** tab.
3. Click to expand **NAT Forwarding** in the left pane.
4. Open the **UPnP** tab under **NAT** **Forwarding**.
5. Toggle the switch to enable **UPnP**.

 You can now close your router's web-based utility and check for any improvements in your network connectivity.

## 3\. Change NAT Type Using Port Forwarding

 Alternatively, you can use the safer [port forwarding method to change your NAT type](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-port-forwarding-and-how-can-it-help-me/) for a specific game title or application. While the process is a little complicated compared to UPnP, port forwarding gives greater control over open ports and their usage with enhanced security.

 To create a new port forwarding entry, you'll need to know the TCP or UDP ports used for your specific game. For example, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War uses the following ports:

`TCP: 3074, 27014-27050  
UDP: 3074-3079`

 To find your game's UDP and TCP ports, perform a web search with your game title for port forwarding. Often, the game developers include port information for the game on their website.

 Alternatively, go to [portforward](https://portforward.com/ports/), select your game, and then your router name and model using the given options. On the following page, scroll down to locate the specific ports for your game. Port Forward keeps a database of ports for games on multiple platforms and for different router makers.

 To change NAT type using Power Forwarding:

1. Log in to your router's web app. In this instance, we'll use TP-Link's web-based utility.
2. Open the **Advanced** tab.
3. In the left pane, click to expand **NAT Forwarding**.  
![TP-Link Web Interface for Port Forwarding Add](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tp-link-port-forwarding-add.jpg)
4. Open the **Port Forwarding** tab.
5. Click the **\+ Add** icon in the top right corner to create a new port forwarding entry.
6. In the **Add a Port Forwarding** **Entry** dialog, type a name for **Service Name**. Make sure to add a name to make it easy to identify this port forwarding entry for future reference.

## Changing NAT Type on Windows to Fix Network Issues

 Changing the NAT type may be necessary to troubleshoot network-related issues. You can enable UPnP or turn on Network Discovery to ease network restrictions. However, we recommend port forwarding to reduce network restrictions without compromising network security.

 You may want to change your NAT type from strict to open when playing multiplayer games online. A strict or moderate NAT type may cause network problems when joining a game party, like abrupt disconnections, lags, and making it difficult to host matches.

 You can change the NAT type on Windows to ease restrictions, resulting in a faster and more reliable network connection. But you must balance your needs with potential security risks when changing the NAT.

## What Is NAT, and What Are the NAT Types?

[Network Address Translation](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-network-address-translation-nat-and-how-does-it-work/) (NAT) is a feature in routers (and firewalls) that translates the private IPv4 address from devices in your home and office to the public IPv4 address assigned to your router by the ISP and vice versa. NAT helps address the limited number of public IPv4 addresses available worldwide.

 A NAT type describes the status of your network connection. The three NAT types are Strict, Moderate, and Open.

* **NAT Type Strict:** It is the most secure of the NAT types but also the most restrictive one. Users with a Strict NAT type can join games hosted by a system with an Open NAT type. However, the connection is dropped if a system with a Moderate NAT type joins the same game.
* **NAT Type Moderate**: It is moderately secure and opens a few ports. Systems with a Moderate NAT type can join other systems using the Moderate or Open NAT type.
* **NAT Type Open**: Choose Open NAT if you want to host matches. It has no restrictions and facilitates data transfer between all devices without restrictions, irrespective of their NAT type or firewall configuration.

 Your default NAT type depends on your router configuration. If you experience network-related issues, changing your NAT type from Strict or Moderate to Open can help. However, be wary of potential security risks associated with changing your NAT type to Open.

## How to Set a Static Private IP Address

 Whether you want to change the NAT type using the UPnP method or port forwarding, you'll need a static IP address to make it work. Since most routers assign a dynamic IP address, you must manually configure a static IP for your Windows device.

 If you already have a static IP address assigned to your device, skip to the following steps to change the NAT type. If not, follow the below steps to [set a static IP address on your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/static-ip-address-windows-pc/):

1. Press **Win + R** to open **Run**.
2. Type **cmd** and click **OK** to open **Command Prompt**.
3. In Command Prompt, type the following command to view your network information:  
`ipconfig`
4. For this guide, we'll set up a static IP for the Ethernet adapter. So, scroll down to the **Ethernet adapter** section and note down the **IPv4 Address**, **Subnet Mask**, and **Default Gateway**.  
![Command Prompt Windows Showing Ipconfig Ethernet Adapter Network Information](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cmd-ipconfig-ethernet-adapter-network-information.jpg)

5. Toggle the switch for **Network Discovery** to turn it on for public networks.

## 2\. Enable UPnP On Your Router

![TP-Link Router Web Interface with UPnP Enabled](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/enable-upnp-tp-link-router.jpg)

 You can change your NAT type to Open by enabling Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) in your router settings. This is the easiest way to change the NAT type, provided you can access your router configuration page. However, there are [security concerns with the UPnP method](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-upnp-and-why-is-it-dangerous-makeuseof-explains/), which hackers may exploit.

 Note that the following steps apply to a TP-Link router. The process to enable UPnP may differ for routers from other manufacturers. Check your router's user manual or manufacturer knowledge base online for instructions.

 Follow these steps to enable UPnP:

1. Log in to your router's web-based utility. To do this, type the default gateway address (for example (<http://192.168.0.1>) in the search bar and press Enter. If not, here's [how to find your router's IP address](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/find-routers-ip-address/).
2. On the router dashboard, open the **Advanced** tab.
3. Click to expand **NAT Forwarding** in the left pane.
4. Open the **UPnP** tab under **NAT** **Forwarding**.
5. Toggle the switch to enable **UPnP**.

 You can now close your router's web-based utility and check for any improvements in your network connectivity.

## 3\. Change NAT Type Using Port Forwarding

 Alternatively, you can use the safer [port forwarding method to change your NAT type](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-port-forwarding-and-how-can-it-help-me/) for a specific game title or application. While the process is a little complicated compared to UPnP, port forwarding gives greater control over open ports and their usage with enhanced security.

 To create a new port forwarding entry, you'll need to know the TCP or UDP ports used for your specific game. For example, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War uses the following ports:

`TCP: 3074, 27014-27050  
UDP: 3074-3079`

 To find your game's UDP and TCP ports, perform a web search with your game title for port forwarding. Often, the game developers include port information for the game on their website.

![TCP UDP port Call of Duty Cold War](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tcp-udp-port-call-of-duty-cold-war.jpg)

 Alternatively, go to [portforward](https://portforward.com/ports/), select your game, and then your router name and model using the given options. On the following page, scroll down to locate the specific ports for your game. Port Forward keeps a database of ports for games on multiple platforms and for different router makers.

 To change NAT type using Power Forwarding:

1. Log in to your router's web app. In this instance, we'll use TP-Link's web-based utility.
2. Open the **Advanced** tab.
3. In the left pane, click to expand **NAT Forwarding**.  
![TP-Link Web Interface for Port Forwarding Add](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tp-link-port-forwarding-add.jpg)

While the process is a little complicated compared to UPnP, port forwarding gives greater control over open ports and their usage with enhanced security.

 To create a new port forwarding entry, you'll need to know the TCP or UDP ports used for your specific game. For example, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War uses the following ports:

`TCP: 3074, 27014-27050  
UDP: 3074-3079`

 To find your game's UDP and TCP ports, perform a web search with your game title for port forwarding. Often, the game developers include port information for the game on their website.

 Alternatively, go to [portforward](https://portforward.com/ports/), select your game, and then your router name and model using the given options. On the following page, scroll down to locate the specific ports for your game. Port Forward keeps a database of ports for games on multiple platforms and for different router makers.

 To change NAT type using Power Forwarding:

1. Log in to your router's web app. In this instance, we'll use TP-Link's web-based utility.
2. Open the **Advanced** tab.
3. In the left pane, click to expand **NAT Forwarding**.

4. Open the **Port Forwarding** tab.
5. Click the **\+ Add** icon in the top right corner to create a new port forwarding entry.
6. In the **Add a Port Forwarding** **Entry** dialog, type a name for **Service Name**. Make sure to add a name to make it easy to identify this port forwarding entry for future reference.

7. In **Device IP Address**, type your computer's static IP address for Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
8. Type your game's port number in the **External** and **Internet Port** fields. You can use a UDP or TCP port, but use the same port in both the **External** **Port** and **Internal Port** fields.
9. Set the **Protocol** field to **All**.
10. Once done, click **Save** to save the port forwarding entry.

 The entry will be saved in the Port Forwarding table. You can enable or disable the entry using the Status toggle switch.

 Apart from port forwarding, you can also change the NAT type by modifying your router's configuration file. However, some router manufacturers, including TP-Link, encrypt the configuration file, making it extremely difficult to make necessary modifications.

## Changing NAT Type on Windows to Fix Network Issues

 Changing the NAT type may be necessary to troubleshoot network-related issues. You can enable UPnP or turn on Network Discovery to ease network restrictions. However, we recommend port forwarding to reduce network restrictions without compromising network security.
