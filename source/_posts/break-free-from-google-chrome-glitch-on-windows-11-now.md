## Break Free From Google Chrome Glitch on Windows 11 Now

 When you rely on Google Chrome for your daily browsing needs, it can be a major inconvenience if the browser suddenly stops opening on your Windows computer. Chances are either corrupted Chrome files or a resource-hungry plugin cause this problem to occur.

 If you're dealing with this issue, this guide is here to help you resolve it and get back to running Google Chrome again.

## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 The first step to take when dealing with Google Chrome not opening is to restart your computer. It refreshes the system resources and can fix any minor issues that may be causing the problem.

## 2\. End Chrome Processes in Task Manager

 If restarting your computer didn't help, you can end all Google Chrome processes currently running in your Task Manager. Here's how to do it:

1. Press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** on your keyboard to open the Task Manager.
2. On the**Processes** tab, look for any Chrome services running.
3. If you find it, right-click on it, and select**End task** .

After doing this, try to open Google Chrome again.

## 3\. Disable Your Antivirus or Firewall Temporarily

 Your antivirus or firewall can sometimes block Chrome from opening. In this case, you can try disabling them for a short while to determine the issue. But be careful as turning off your antivirus leaves your computer vulnerable.

1. Click on Start and search for**Windows Security** .
2. Select**Virus & threat protection** from the left pane.
3. Under**Virus & threat protection settings** , click on**Manage settings** .
4. Toggle off the**Real-time protection** switch.

 Upon completing the above steps, close the window and restart your computer. When the system starts up, open the Chrome browser and check if the problem has been fixed.

## 4\. Run Compatibility Troubleshooter

 If Google Chrome is still not opening on your Windows computer, you can run the compatibility troubleshooter to reset your Google Chrome settings. This will identify and solve any compatibility problems that may be causing the issue.

To run the compatibility troubleshooter, use these steps:

1. Right-click the Google Chrome shortcut on the taskbar.
2. In the menu that pops up, right-click on**Google Chrome** and choose**Properties** .
3. In the Properties window, switch to the**Compatibility** tab.
4. Next, click the**Run compatibility troubleshooter** button.

5. Then follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process.

 After completing the above steps, launch Google Chrome again and see if it works now.

## 5\. Delete the Chrome User Profile

 If you're still having trouble, it might be time to delete the Chrome user profile. This will erase all your personal information, so make sure to back up any relevant data.

 Usually, you delete Chrome user profiles through the browser itself. But given that you can't open it, here's an alternate way:

1. Open Windows File Explorer and go to the following location. Alternatively, launch the Run dialog (see[how to open Run on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) ), enter the path below, and click**OK** :  
C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Google
2. Right-click the**Chrome** folder and select**Delete** from the context menu.

 After you follow the above steps, restart your computer and try opening Google Chrome again.

## 6\. Reinstall Google Chrome

 Sometimes, certain files that are essential for Google Chrome to run correctly may become corrupted or damaged, causing the browser to behave abnormally or stop working altogether. Uninstalling and reinstalling Google Chrome can help replace any damaged or corrupted files.

To reinstall Google Chrome, follow these steps:

1. Press**Win + I** on your keyboard to open the Settings menu.
2. In the Windows Settings app, click**Apps > Installed apps** .
3. Find**Google Chrome** in the list of installed apps.
4. Click the three dots next to it and select**Uninstall** .

5. To confirm, click**Uninstall** again.
6. Follow the prompts to complete the uninstallation process.

 After you follow the above steps, restart your computer. Once that is done, visit the[Google Chrome download page](https://www.google.com/chrome/) , then download and install the application.
