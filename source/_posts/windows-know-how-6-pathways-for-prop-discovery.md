## Windows Know-How: 6 Pathways for Prop Discovery

 Windows offers the feature to view the properties of any file or folder present on the disk. For many, it may appear as a non-useful utility because you can see a lot of data in File Explorer by changing the icons view. But you can do much more than just view metadata information in the Properties Window.

 Apart from checking out the file type, location, size, and creation data, you can apply access restrictions and even encrypt the folder contents. Moreover, you can enable or disable file sharing, add security measures and customize icons. So, without further ado, let us dive deep into the multiple methods to open file or folder properties in Windows.

## How to Open File or Folder Properties in Windows

 Here are some easy ways to view the file or folder properties on a Windows PC. These methods will work for Windows 11 and older versions of Windows OS too.

### 1\. Using the Keyboard Shortcut

 You can view the file properties using the pre-defined shortcut keys on Windows. Here’s how to do it:

1. Press**Win + E** to launch File Explorer on your system.
2. Click on a file or folder to select it.
3. Then press**Alt + Enter** keys at once to open the file properties window.

### 2\. Using the Mouse and Keyboard Shortcut

 This method eliminates the usage of the enter key to open the file properties windows. Repeat the following steps to open the properties window:

1. Open the File Explorer app and navigate to the folder location.
2. Now, hold the**Alt** key and**double-click** on the file to display its properties.

### 3\. Using the Context Menu

 If you don’t want to use the keyboard at all, then you can open the file properties using the context menu.

1. Press**Win + R** to[launch the Run command box](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) and type**explorer.exe** . Press the enter key to open the File Explorer.
2. Navigate to the desired file or folder location.
3. Now,**right-click** on the file and select the**Properties** option from the context menu.

4. The file properties window will launch on your system.

 Keep in mind that the right-click context menu will look a bit different from the older versions of Windows.

### 4\. Using the File Explorer

### 5\. Using the CMD Tool

 The above-mentioned shortcuts launch the Properties window which shows the GUI version of File Properties. But, you can also view the properties of a folder or file using the command prompt on Windows. Repeat the following steps to view file properties using the command prompt utility:

1. Press**Win + R** to launch the Run command box. Type**cmd** in the text box and press**Ctrl + Shift + Enter** key at once.
2. UAC will pop up. Click on the**Yes** button to open the command prompt with administrator permissions.
3. Now, enter the following command and press the enter key: **wmic datafile where "name='File Path'" list full**
4. Replace the “**File Path** ” with the actual location of your file. We have a text file saved on the desktop. So, the command to display its properties will be: **wmic datafile where "name='C:\\\\Users\\\\Test\\\\Desktop\\\\rr.txt'" list full**

1. Press**Win + S** and type PowerShell. Click on the first search result to launch PowerShell on your system.
2. Now, type the following command:**Get-Item -Path File Path | fl \***
