<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Now check if your keyboard is working properly.

## 8\. Scan for Malicious Programs

 If you downloaded any suspicious file or program, then the chances are that your keyboard is experiencing interference due to malware, spyware, or other malicious programs.

 To make sure it isn't the case, you can[check if a file is infected with a virus or not](https://www.makeuseof.com/check-suspicious-file-malware/) . In case you find one, you need to[scan your computer for viruses and then remove them](https://www.makeuseof.com/scan-for-viruses-without-buying-antivirus-software/) .

 If you are more comfortable with command line tools, then[use Windows PowerShell to scan and remove any malicious components](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-powershell-to-scan-windows-10-for-malware/) from your system.

## 9\. Switch to a Different Keyboard

 Sometimes the problem is not others but the keyboard itself. It could have defective keys or some other hardware issue preventing it from functioning correctly; in that case, try using your device on another computer or laptop to be sure that the problem is not the operating system or software.

 If you find that your keyboard is the issue, then it’s time to replace it with a new one or get it repaired.
