## How to Fix a Yellow Tint on a Windows Laptop Screen

 Discovering a yellow tint on your laptop screen can be quite frustrating. Not only does it affect your work and entertainment experience, but it also leaves you wondering what could be causing this unwelcome hue. This color change can happen because of both hardware or software issues on your system.

 To fix the yellow tint on your laptop screen, it is important to explore the common causes behind it and learn about the different solutions that can be applied.

## Common Causes of Yellow Tint on Laptop Screen

 Before we move on to fix the yellow tint, let's first explore the usual suspects that could be responsible for this color anomaly. Understanding the potential culprits is the key to effectively addressing the issue.

### 1\. Hardware Issues

 One of the primary reasons behind a yellow tint on your laptop screen can be hardware-related problems. If components of the screen or the display cable are faulty or damaged, they can affect color rendering and lead to discoloration issues.

### 2\. Software Settings

 Sometimes, it's the software settings on your laptop that are responsible for the yellow tint. You might have [enabled the Night Light feature](https://www.makeuseof.com/enable-night-light-windows-10-11/), for instance, that can adjust the color temperature of your screen to reduce blue light exposure but also inadvertently cause a yellowish hue.

### 3\. Graphics Driver Problems

 Your laptop's graphics driver plays a pivotal role in rendering colors on the screen. Outdated or corrupted graphics drivers can lead to display issues, including the dreaded yellow tint.

### 4\. Color Profiles

 Color profiles define how your laptop interprets and displays colors. An incorrect color profile can skew color representation, leading to a yellowish screen.

### 1\. Fix Hardware Issues (Faulty Screen, Faulty Display Cable)

 Begin by conducting a thorough physical inspection of your laptop's screen. Look for any visible cracks, damage, or anomalies on the screen surface. Physical damage to the screen can lead to color abnormalities, including a yellowish tint.

 If you notice any physical damage, such as a cracked or damaged screen, it's best to consult a professional technician or your laptop's manufacturer for a screen replacement.

 If there is no visible screen damage, turn your attention to the display cable. Ensure that it is securely connected to both the screen and the laptop's motherboard. A loose or damaged display cable can lead to display problems, including color irregularities. Carefully reattach the cable to ensure a secure connection.

### 2\. Turn Off the Night Light

 If you've noticed a yellow tint on your laptop screen and suspect software settings might be the culprit, this method will show you how to disable the Night Light feature. This feature can adjust your screen's color temperature, and turning it off can help restore normal colors.

1. Click the Windows **Start button** to access the “Start menu.”
2. Select the **Settings** (gear-shaped) icon to launch the Windows Settings.
