## Boosting Your PC: How To Turn On Hyper-V in Win11

 Hyper-V is Microsoft's in-house virtualization solution for Windows 11\. It lets you create virtual machines and run them on virtual hardware. That said, if you want to use Hyper-V on your computer, you will need to enable it first.

 In this article, we show you the how to enable Hyper-V in Windows 11 and create virtual machines without third-party tools.

## What Are the Use Cases for Hyper-V?

 Hyper-V is a native virtualization tool that allows you to run multiple operating systems on your system virtually without affecting your host OS.

 With Hyper-V, you don’t have to rely on third-party hypervisor solutions such as VirtualBox and VMware Workstation. [Hyper-V has plenty of use cases for individuals](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/reasons-start-using-virtual-machine/), and even more for organizations.

 Some Hyper-V virtual machine use cases include:

* Run and test software for an older version of Windows or non-Windows OS
* Test software on multiple operating systems using multiple virtual machines on a single host system.
* Offers disaster recovery features including live migration and failover clustering for increased uptime.
* Create and run virtual machines in isolation for improved security.

## Prerequisites to Enable Hyper-V on Windows 11
