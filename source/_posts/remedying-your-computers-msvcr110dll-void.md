## Remedying Your Computer’s Msvcr110.dll Void

 DLL (Dynamic Link Library) errors are very frustrating and can appear even if you have the mentioned missing file on your computer. One such error is the Msvcr110.dll missing error which appears upon launching a program.

 Fortunately, like most DLL errors, the Msvcr110.dll missing error can easily be cured. Here are all the working fixes that will help you eliminate the Msvcr110.dll error.

## What Is the Msvcr110.dll Missing Error?

 Most applications require DLL files to run on a Windows PC. When a particular DLL file is unavailable on your computer, the operating system will fail to fetch the information from the file and throw the DLL missing error.

 Msvcr in Msvcr110.dll stands for Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable, a very common format for Windows applications. You will see this error message when you try to launch a program that requires Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2012.

 The error appears when there's corruption in the Msvcr110.dll file or if it is missing from your computer. Additionally, you can see this error due to misconfigured registry settings or infection caused by malware or viruses.
