## Is Resetting Window Backup Risky?

 While resetting Windows Backup is generally safe, there are some risks associated with it.

 Firstly, you may lose all existing backups if you reset Windows Backup. To ensure you don't lose data, [create a backup of the existing Windows files](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-windows-files-folders/) before resetting Windows Backup.

 Furthermore, the reset may affect some third-party apps. It's wise to check with your software vendor before resetting Windows Backup.

 If something goes wrong during the reset, you may have a corrupted backup configuration. In such cases, reinstall the operating system and start from scratch.

 Overall, resetting Windows Backup helps resolve existing issues, but take the necessary precautions to avoid potential risks.

### 1\. Using Command Prompt

 If your current backup configuration isn't working, reset Windows Backup to its default settings. To get started, [run the Command Prompt with admin access](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/). In the Command Prompt window, run the following command:

`reg delete HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsBackup /f`

 This will reset to the default configuration and remove all existing backups.

 After that, copy and paste the following command into the Command Prompt window and press **Enter**:

`reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsBackup`

 This will recreate the WindowsBackup entry in the registry editor. Next, type in and run the below command to delete the Automatic Backup scheduled task on Windows:

`schtasks /delete /tn "Microsoft\Windows\WindowsBackup\AutomaticBackup" /f`

 Finally, execute the below command to delete the backup monitor scheduled task:

`schtasks /delete /tn "Microsoft\Windows\WindowsBackup\Windows Backup Monitor" /f`

 After executing the above commands, restart your computer. This will reset Windows Backup to its default settings.

`<code>reg delete HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsBackup /f  
reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsBackup  
schtasks /delete /tn "Microsoft\Windows\WindowsBackup\AutomaticBackup" /f  
schtasks /delete /tn "Microsoft\Windows\WindowsBackup\Windows Backup Monitor" /f`

 Click the **File** menu and select **Save as**. On the Save as dialog, type **reset-backup.bat** as the file name. Then choose **All Files** from the drop-down menu next to the Save as type. From the left panel, select **Desktop** and click the **Save** button.
