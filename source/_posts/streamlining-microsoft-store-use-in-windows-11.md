## 5\. Check Registry Editor

 If you’re using Windows Home, there’s a chance the Group Policy is missing on your computer. However, you can edit the Registry to unblock the Microsoft Store.

 Launch Registry Editor with administrative rights and head to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE > SOFTWARE > Policies > Microsoft > WindowsStore** . Then, in the right pane, delete the**RemoveWindowsStore** value.

 Restart your computer and check if the Microsoft Store is now unblocked.
