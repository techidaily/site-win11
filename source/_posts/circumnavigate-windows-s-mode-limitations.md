## Get Rid of Windows S Mode

 It's not difficult to solve why you can't exit the S mode on your Windows PC. Check Microsoft services, update the Microsoft Store app, and sign out and sign in again. Then, rename the SoftwareDistribution folder, reset all system apps, and do an In-place Upgrade to fix the issue if everything fails.

 Windows S Mode is a restricted version of Windows 11 and 10 where you can only install apps from the Microsoft Store, cannot access the Registry or the Group Policy Editor, and are stuck with Edge and Bing as the default browser and search engine. To install an app unavailable in the Microsoft Store, you must get out of Windows S Mode and upgrade. But sometimes, you can't switch out of the S mode because of an error.

 Try these fixes to get out of the Windows S mode for good.

## 1\. Check Microsoft Servers Status

[Windows S mode has its merits and drawbacks](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-s-mode-guide/); the only way to exit it is via the Microsoft Store. But if Microsoft Servers are down due to any issues, you will face issues when trying to get out of the S mode. So, check the official [Microsoft Service status](https://admin.microsoft.com/servicestatus) website or Microsoft Store's [X page](https://twitter.com/MicrosoftStore) for outage reports.

 You can also check out third-party websites like [Down Detector](https://downdetector.com/). In such a case, patiently wait while Microsoft fixes the issue. If you use a [VPN service](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-great-free-vpn-services-compared-which-is-fastest/) on your PC, temporarily disconnect from it and then retry exiting the S mode.

## 2\. Check the Microsoft Store Install Service

 Microsoft Update service handles all the update-related tasks on your PC. With any glitch, you must restart it to get it working again.

1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open Task Manger.
2. Click on **Services**.
3. Find the **wauserv** service in the list and right-click on it. Select **Restart**.  
![Restart the Windows Update service](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/restart-the-windows-update-service.jpg)
4. Exitthe Task Manager.

## 3\. Sign out and Sign in Again

 You can try signing out of the Microsoft Store and then signing back in. After that, you can reattempt exiting the S mode.

1. Launch Microsoft Store.
2. Click on **Profile >** **Sign out**.
3. ![Sign out of Microsoft Store-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sign-out-of-microsoft-store-1.jpg)
4. Close and relaunch the Microsoft Store app.
5. Click on the **Profile >** **Sign in** \> **Select** your Microsoft Account and click on **Continue**.  
![Sign in to Microsoft Store-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sign-in-to-microsoft-store-1.jpg)
6. Enter your PC **PIN** and then complete the login process.
7. Retry switching out of S mode.

## 4\. Update All Store Apps

 Outdated apps, including the Microsoft Store, can pose issues while trying to leave S mode. You must update all of them using the Microsoft Store update section. Even the update for the Microsoft Store app is available here.

1. Launch the Microsoft Store app.
2. Navigate to the bottom left area and click on the **Library** icon.
3. Click on the **Get updates** button to check for all the available updates.
4. Click on the **Update all** button.
5. Wait for the updates to install, and then close the Microsoft Store app.
6. Restartyour PC.

## 5\. Set the Correct Date and Time

 Incorrect date and time settings on your PC can cause problems while installing or removing Windows features. So, you must manually sync the date and time settings with Windows servers.

1. Go to the system tray notifications area and right-click the **Date and time** icon.
2. Click on the **Adjust date and time** option.
3. Scroll down to the **Additional settings** section and click the **Sync now** button.  
![Sync the Date and Time](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sync-the-date-and-time.jpg)
