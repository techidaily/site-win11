## Restoring Compatibility of Brightness Controls via Fn Key Win 11

 You may usually get eye strain or headaches when the brightness of your laptop or PC monitor is too low. Issues like this can be easily solved by adjusting the brightness with a simple press of the brightness function key.

 However, things get tricky if this key does not work anymore or has stopped functioning. In such cases, you may need to take a few steps in order to fix the brightness function key not working on Windows PC.

## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 Keyboard issues can sometimes be fixed with a simple restart. Restarting your computer will reset the keyboard settings and may make the brightness key work again.

## 2\. Clean Your Keyboard to Remove Dirt and Grime

## 4\. Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter

 This should help you fix the issue of your keyboard not functioning properly.

## 9\. Switch to a Different Keyboard

 Sometimes the problem is not others but the keyboard itself. It could have defective keys or some other hardware issue preventing it from functioning correctly; in that case, try using your device on another computer or laptop to be sure that the problem is not the operating system or software.

 If you find that your keyboard is the issue, then it’s time to replace it with a new one or get it repaired.
