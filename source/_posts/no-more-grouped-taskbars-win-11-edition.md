## No More Grouped Taskbars: Win 11 Edition

 Microsoft first introduced icon grouping on the Windows taskbar in Windows 10\. Certain users dislike this functionality and want to change their taskbars to behave like the old tab system.

 What if you like the icons, but don't like how they group together? Let's have a look at how to disable taskbar icon grouping in Windows 11\.

## What Is Taskbar Icon Grouping?

 Icon grouping is when Windows 11 combines multiple windows of a single program together. For example, having multiple File Explorer windows open will show as one File Explorer icon with multiple tabs behind it.

 This results in a cleaner and less cluttered taskbar, but one that gives you significantly less information. Some users [restore the old taskbar labels on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-10-taskbar-labels/), but this takes up more space on your taskbar than the icons do.

## How to Disable Taskbar Icon Grouping

 The quickest way to disable this function is to use a program called Windhawk. Windhawk carries a number of quality-of-life modifications for Windows 11\.

 To start, head over to [the Windhawk website](https://windhawk.net) and download the program. Install it and run it afterward.

 Click on the **Explore** button, and search for **Disable grouping on the taskbar.** Go into **Details** and hit the **Install** button. After a few seconds, it'll be enabled, but you may need to [restart Windows File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-restart-file-explorer-windows-10/) or your overall system to see the difference.

 You can also modify how the modification behaves by clicking **Details** and then **Settings.** You can enable or disable features like keeping the icons together, or to separate the pinned apps from the rest of the open windows.

## Exploring the Other Taskbar Mods on Windhawk

 Windhawk has a range of other modifications for different aspects of Windows 11\. If you search just **taskbar** into Windhawk, you'll see a few other options.

 Since you're already modifying your taskbar, it can't hurt to look into these. Features that aren't usually supported by Windows, such as middle-clicking to close a taskbar window, can be found here, and are as simple to install as the above.

## Achieve Supreme Taskbar Flexibility With Windhawk

 When it comes to tweaking your taskbar, the default Windows options can sometimes be lacking. While many modifications on Windhawk can be major changes, most that relate to the taskbar are minor or subtle changes. Regardless, these small alterations can greatly enhance the user experience.
