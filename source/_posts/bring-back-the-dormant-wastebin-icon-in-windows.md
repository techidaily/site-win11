## Bring Back the Dormant Wastebin Icon in Windows

 The Recycle Bin has been a staple on Windows for a long time, but not everyone wants it on the desktop. You can disable it via the Desktop Icon Settings, but there is a bug where if you try to re-enable it, the "Recycle Bin" option is grayed out and cannot be toggled.

 Fortunately, you can fix the issue by reverting specific changes in the Registry Editor or the Group Policy Editor.

## 1\. How to Bring Back the Recycle Bin Using the Group Policy Editor

 The Group Policy Editor lets you show or hide the Recycle Bin icon from the desktop. Check if you have modified and accidentally disabled the Recycle Bin group policy recently. If so you can set the Remove Recycle Bin icon from the desktop policy to "Not Configured" which will restore it.

 You may not find the Local Group Policy Editor in Windows Home Edition. However, you can run a batch script to [enable Group Policy Editor on the Windows Home edition](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/) or skip to the Registry Editor-based fix in the next step.

 To restore the Recycle Bin icon using the Group Policy Editor:

1. Press **Win + R** to open **Run**.
2. Type **gpedit.msc** and click **OK** to open the **Group Policy Editor**.

3. Next, navigate to the following location:  
`User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Desktop`
4. In the right pane, locate and double-click on the **Remove Recycle Bin icon from the desktop** option to open its properties.

 If you can’t access Group Policy Editor or if the issue persists, you can use the Registry Editor to fix this problem.

## 2\. Modify the Recycle Bin Registry Settings

 Another way to resolve and restore the grayed-out Recycle Bin icon in the Desktop settings is via the Windows Registry. You can modify the registry entry value responsible for the settings and configurations of Recycle Bin working to restore the functionality.

 Making modifications to the Windows registry involves tweaking settings that may harm your device if performed incorrectly. We recommend you [create a Windows restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) and [take a Windows registry backup](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) before attempting to modify the Windows registry.

 To modify the Recycle Bin registry value:

1. Press **Win + R** to open **Run**.
2. Type **regedit** and click **OK**. Click **Yes** if prompted by **User Account Control**.
3. In the Registry Editor, navigate to the following location. You can copy and paste the path in the editor for quicker navigation:  
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\NonEnum`
4. In the right pane, locate the **{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}** DWORD (32-bit) value.
