## Winning Strategy Against C0000022 System Collapse

 The Windows “fatal error C0000022” fault typically occurs when the system attempts to install Windows updates or apply the ones that are downloaded. It can be caused due to both hardware and software-related issues.

 Below, we take a look at the different solutions you can try to fix this problem for good.

## 1\. Perform a Hard Reset

 A hard reset means forcibly restarting your device and is a useful initial troubleshooting step to resolve the error C0000022\.

 In the case of this error, it will help fix any temporary issues caused by the hardware components or peripherals connected to the computer. It will also resolve temporary software issues, such as corrupted system files, conflicting processes, or incorrect memory allocations that might be contributing to the update's fatal error.

 Here is how you can perform a hard reset:

1. Power off your computer by pressing and holding the power button.
2. Once the computer has been completely powered off, unplug the power cord from the back. In case you are using a laptop, you can remove its battery if it is easily accessible.
3. Wait for a few minutes before connecting the cords and inserting the battery again.
4. Finally, press the power button to turn on your computer. Once the computer restarts, you can try downloading the update again via Windows Settings. Alternatively, you can head over to the [Microsoft update catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/) and download the update from there, manually.

## 2\. Run Automatic Startup Repair

![Startup Repair Screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Startup-Repair-Screen.jpg)

 If performing a hard reset did not work, and you have encountered the fatal error again while booting, you can run an automatic startup repair.

 This tool is specifically designed to diagnose and fix problems that prevent Windows from starting correctly. Here's how you can run Automatic Startup Repair:

1. Start your computer and allow it to boot. If the fatal error appears again, the system should automatically detect this and initiate a repair process.
2. If the automatic repair process does not start automatically, power off your computer by holding the power button until it shuts down. Repeat this process twice. Upon doing it the third time, your computer should enter the recovery environment. Choose **Troubleshoot** \> **Advanced options** \> **Startup Repair** from there.
3. Wait for the repair process to complete and then follow the on-screen instructions provided by the Startup Repair tool to proceed.
4. After the repair process finishes, your device will either restart automatically or prompt you to restart it. Upon reboot, hopefully, you will not face the fatal error again.

## 3\. Update in Safe Mode

 There is also a chance that a background process or service is conflicting with the update process, leading to the error at hand. The best way to isolate the cause of the error is by booting into Safe Mode.

 This mode boots Windows with only the basic drivers and services required for the operating system to function. This excludes many third-party drivers and services that might be causing conflicts or errors. Once you have booted into the Safe Mode, you can determine if the error still occurs.

 Follow these steps to proceed:

1. Press the **Win** \+ **S** keys together to open the Windows Search utility.
2. Type "System Configuration" in the search bar and click **Open**.
3. In the following dialog, head over to the **Boot** tab and checkmark the box with **Safe Boot**.  
![Safe Mode option in the Boot tab](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Safe-Mode.jpg)
4. Check the **Network** option and then click **Apply** \> **OK** to save the changes. Now, restart your computer and upon reboot, Safe Mode will be launched automatically. You can now try to install the required update again.

 In case you cannot access the Safe Mode this way, you can boot into the Windows Recovery Environment and launch it from there.

 You can also [perform a System Restore](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-reset-system-restore-difference/) in Safe Mode, which will help you revert the system to a state where the issue at hand was not present.

## 4\. Identify Hardware-Related Issues

 Hardware problems can cause various errors and instability in operating systems. If the software-related fixes we have listed above did not work, it is time to identify any hardware-related issues that might be contributing to the error.

![RAM in a laptop](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RAM-in-laptop.jpg)

 Malfunctioning hardware components, including failing hard drives, faulty RAM modules, or defective graphics cards, can be a possible cause of the error. Additionally, hardware incompatibility or conflicts between different components can also lead to errors like the one you are experiencing.

 To proceed with the hardware troubleshooting, follow these steps:

* **Check hardware connections**: Ensure all hardware components, such as cables and cards are connected properly.
* **Run hardware diagnostics**: You can [run the Windows Hardware and Devices troubleshooter](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-device-manager-unresponsive-fix/) to pinpoint the issue and fix it. Alternatively, there are several third-party options that can help you do the same.
* **Update drivers and firmware**: The issue might be popping up because the drivers installed on your computer or the firmware itself is outdated. You can update them both to see if that makes any difference.
* **Swap hardware components**: If you suspect a particular hardware component to be the culprit, you can replace it and try installing the updates again.

 If the problem is related to the hardware installed on your computer, hopefully, one of these steps will help you fix the problem or at least identify it successfully.

## Update Error C0000022 Resolved

 Updates errors can be frustrating, especially if they prevent you from accessing the system at all. Hopefully, the methods listed above will help you fix the fatal error for good. If it reappears, you can connect with the official Microsoft support team and report the issue to them for an official fix.

 To prevent such issues from occurring in the future, we highly recommend keeping your drivers up-to-date. You can also perform regular system scans using the System File Checker and Deployment Image Servicing and Management to avoid any corruption errors contributing to the problem.
