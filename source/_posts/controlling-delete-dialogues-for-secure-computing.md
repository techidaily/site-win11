## Controlling Delete Dialogues for Secure Computing

 When you delete a file or folder on Windows, it is automatically moved to the Recycle Bin without any confirmation. If you don't want that, you can configure Windows to display a confirmation dialog when deleting files.

 You can enable or disable the delete confirmation dialog via Recycle Bin Properties, Registry Editor, or Group Policy Editor. Let's go over each of these methods one by one.

## 1\. Enable or Disable Delete Confirmation Dialog via Recycle Bin's Properties

 The easiest way to enable or disable the delete confirmation prompt on Windows is through Recycle Bin Properties. Here's how to go about it.

1. Right-click on the**Recycle Bin** icon on the desktop and select**Properties** .
2. In the**Recycle Bin Properties** window, tick the**Display delete confirmation dialog** checkbox.
3. Click**Apply** followed by**OK** .

 Once you complete the above steps, Windows should display the delete confirmation dialog every time you move something to the Recycle Bin.

 If you want to disable the delete confirmation dialog in the future, repeat the above steps and uncheck the**Display delete confirmation dialog** checkbox.

## 2\. Enable or Disable Delete Confirmation Dialog Using Group Policy Editor

 If youâ€™re a system administrator, you might prefer using the Group Policy Editor to make system-level changes. In that case, you can use the following steps to enable or disable the delete confirmation dialog on Windows.

 Note that Group Policy Editor is a feature reserved for the Professional, Enterprise, and Education editions of Windows. If you're using Windows Home, you'll need to enable the Group Policy Editor first. Check out[how to access the group policy editor on Windows Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/) and follow the steps outlined there.

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run dialog.
2. Type**gpedit.msc** in the box and press**Enter** . This will[open the Local Group Policy Editor](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/open-local-group-policy-editor-windows/) .
3. Use the left pane to navigate to **User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > File Explorer** .
4. Double-click the**Display confirmation dialog when deleting files** policy.
5. Select the**Enabled** radio button.
6. Click**Apply** followed by**OK** .

## 3\. Enable or Disable Delete Confirmation Dialog With Registry Editor

 If the above methods do not work for some reason, you can make a few changes in the Registry Editor to enable or disable the delete confirmation prompt on Windows. Since Windows Registry holds critical settings for Windows operating system, make sure you[back up all the registry files](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) or[create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) before proceeding.

 To enable or disable the delete confirmation dialog using Registry Editor:

1. Press**Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type**registry editor** in the box and select the first result that appears.
3. Select**Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
4. Use the left pane to navigate to **HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER > Software > Microsoft > Windows > CurrentVersion > Policies > Explorer** .
5. Right-click on the Explorer key and select**New > DWORD (32-bit) Value** . Name it**ConfirmFileDelete** .
6. Double-click the newly created DWORD.
7. In the**Value data** field, enter**1** to enable the delete confirmation dialog.
8. Click**OK** and restart your PC to apply the changes.

 After the reboot, Windows should display the delete confirmation dialog when you try to delete something. If you want to undo this change at any time, follow the same steps above and change the value data for**ConfirmFileDelete** to**0** . Alternatively, you can delete the**ConfirmFileDelete** entry altogether.

## Enabling or Disabling the Delete Confirmation Dialog on Windows

 The delete confirmation dialog might not be exciting to see, but it is definitely useful. On the other hand, if you're cleaning up old files on your computer, you might want to disable the confirmation dialog for a while. Either way, enabling or disabling the delete confirmation dialog is pretty simple.

 And as difficult as it may sound, it's actually very easy to restore accidentally deleted files on Windows.
