## Resolving a Swaying Cursor in Windows OS

 A flickering mouse pointer issue on Windows is more common than you might think. In most cases, you may be able to fix it with a system reboot. However, if that does not work, you may need to dig deep to find the underlying cause.

 As with most Windows issues, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for this. That said, working your way through the following fixes should stop the mouse pointer from flickering on your Windows 10 or 11 PC.

## 1\. Rule Out Issues With Your Mouse

 Before diving into advanced troubleshooting methods, it’s a good idea to try some basic fixes. You can start by disconnecting your mouse and reconnecting to resolve any temporary issues.

 While you are at it, inspect your mouse and its cable for any damage. If possible, you can also test your mouse on another computer to rule out any hardware problems.

## 2\. Disable Touch Input

 One common reason why your mouse pointer may keep flickering on Windows is if you are using a touchscreen monitor or laptop. This could be due to conflicts between the touch input and the traditional mouse input on Windows.

 A number of users on [Microsoft Community](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/mouse-cursor-flickering-on-windows-10/1ac2f0be-188d-4404-aa43-28a203dc1f48) reported fixing the mouse pointer flickering problem by simply disabling touch input on their Windows computers. You can also give this method a try.

 To disable touch input on your Windows computer, use these steps:

1. Right-click on the **Start icon** or press **Win + X** to open the Power User menu.
2. Select **Device Manager** from the list.
3. Click the arrow on the left of **Human Interface Devices** to expand it.
4. Locate the **HID-compliant touch screen** entry. Right-click on it and select **Disable device**.
5. Click **Yes** when the confirmation prompt appears.

 In some instances, you may see two entries named **HID-compliant touch screen**. In that case, you will need to disable both of them.

## 3\. Disable the Biometric Devices

 Such issues can also arise due to biometric devices connected to your computer. You can try disabling them to see if that restores normalcy.

 To disable biometric devices on Windows, follow these steps:

1. Press **Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type "device manager" in the search box and select the first result that appears.
3. Double-click on **Biometric devices** to expand it.
4. Right-click on the device you want to disable and select **Disable device**.

 After completing the above steps, check if the mouse pointer still flickers for no reason.

## 4\. Restart the Windows Explorer Process

 Windows Explorer is a system process that manages the graphical user interface (GUI) for several utilities, including your desktop and taskbar. If this process is experiencing any issues, you are likely to run into problems.

 In most cases, you can fix issues with the Windows Explorer (aka File Explorer) process by restarting it. This will refresh graphical elements and eliminate any temporary glitches that may be causing the mouse to flicker.

 To restart the Windows Explorer process:

1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open the Task Manager app.
2. Switch to the **Processes** tab.
3. Look for the **Windows Explorer** entry in the list of processes. Right-click on it and select **Restart**.

 Your taskbar will disappear for a few seconds and then reappear automatically. After that, the mouse pointer should not blink or flicker on Windows.

## 5\. Run the Hardware and Device Troubleshooter

 Another thing you can do to stop your mouse pointer from flickering or blinking on Windows is run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. It can help resolve issues with all your external devices, including the mouse.

 Since the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter is no longer available in the Settings app or Control Panel, you will have to use the Run command to access it. Here are the steps you can follow to run the troubleshooter.

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type **msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic** in the text field and click **OK** or press **Enter**.
3. In the Hardware and Devices window, click the **Advanced** option.
4. Tick the **Apply repairs automatically** checkbox.
5. Click **Next**.

## 7\. Try Generic Windows Fixes

 If your mouse cursor continues to flicker or blink even after applying the above tips, you can try some generic Windows fixes to resolve the underlying issue.

* **Run the SFC Scan:** Your mouse pointer could malfunction if some of the system files on your PC are damaged. You can [run the SFC (System File Checker) scan on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/) to fix any problematic system files.
* **Install Windows Updates:** Windows updates often include bug fixes and stability improvements for your computer. It’s a good idea to [install pending Windows updates](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-manually/) if you continue to experience issues with the mouse pointer.
* **Scan for Malware:** The presence of malware can also result in such unusual mouse pointer behavior. To rule out this possibility, [use PowerShell to scan your Windows PC for malware](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-powershell-to-scan-windows-10-for-malware/).
* **Try Clean Boot:** It’s possible that a rogue program or service running in the background is causing the mouse pointer to malfunction. If that’s the case, [performing a clean boot on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/) will help you verify that.
