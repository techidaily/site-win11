## Quick-Fix Guide: Overcome Incompatibility in Windows XP

 The Program Compatibility Troubleshooter is a tool from Microsoft that checks for and resolves compatibility issues when running older applications on newer versions of Windows. However, sometimes the troubleshooter fails to work as expected.

 If you're facing this issue, there are several possible causes and ways to fix it. Let's look into them below.

## 1\. Check For Corrupted System Files

 Corrupted system files can cause the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter not to work correctly. To ensure all your system files are functioning properly, run the built-in System File Checker utility on Windows. Here's how to do it:

1. Right-click on**Start** and select**Run** from the menu list.
2. Type**cmd** in the text box and press**Ctrl + Shift + Enter** on your keyboard.
3. If UAC appears on the screen, click**Yes** to grant privileges.

4. In Command Prompt type the below command and hit Enter:  
`sfc /scannow`

 Wait for the scan to finish. This may take several minutes and your PC may restart once or twice during the process. Once the scan is completed, check if the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter works now.

## 2\. Repair Corrupted System Image

 If the System File Checker was unable to repair corrupt system files, you can use the DISM tool from Command Prompt to fix them. Here's how to do it:

1. Use one of the many [ways to run Command Prompt as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/) to get an elevated prompt running.

2. In Command Prompt, type the below command and hit**Enter** :  
`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth`

 The DISM tool will start scanning the system for corruption. It can take up to 20 minutes, but it is worth waiting because it can repair a lot of system issues. Once the scan is completed, restart your computer and check if the issue is fixed.
