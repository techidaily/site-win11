##  Use a Keyboard Key to Delete a PivotTable

 A quick way to remove a PivotTable from your spreadsheet is to use your keyboard's Delete key.

 To start, launch your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel. Then, in your spreadsheet, select the PivotTable you want to delete.

![Select the entire PivotTable.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1-select-entire-pivottable.png) 

 While your table is selected, on your keyboard, press the Delete key.

 Excel shows no warning when you use the Delete key to remove a table, so make sure you're okay with losing your table's data.

 If you ever accidentally delete a table, you can restore it by quickly pressing Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Command+Z (Mac).
