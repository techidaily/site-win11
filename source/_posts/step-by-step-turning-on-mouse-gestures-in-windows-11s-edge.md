## Step-by-Step: Turning on Mouse Gestures in Windows 11'S Edge

 Mouse gestures allow you to control your browser with simple mouse movements. You can use them to quickly open new tabs, refresh web pages, close opened tabs, and much more.

 Microsoft Edge comes with a built-in mouse gesture feature; however, it is disabled by default. This article will show how to enable mouse gestures in Microsoft Edge on Windows 11\.

## How to Enable Mouse Gestures in Microsoft Edge

 Adding mouse gestures to Microsoft Edge is a simple process. You just need to [ensure you have the latest Edge update installed](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-chrome-firefox-edge-desktop-mobile/) on your computer.

 Once you've done that, follow these steps to enable mouse gestures in Edge:

1. Launch Edge, click the **three dots** at the top-right corner, and choose **Settings** from the context menu.
2. Choose **Appearance** from the left sidebar, and turn on the toggle next to **Enable Mouse Gesture**.

 And that's about it. The mouse gestures feature is now enabled in Edge.

 You can also customize mouse gesture settings. To do this, select the **Configure Mouse Gestures** option and set the action of each gesture. Remember that [Windows 11 comes with its own touchpad gestures](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-touchpad-gesture-guide/), so if you're on a laptop, make sure the two don't overlap.

 For example, if you want Edge to open a new window when you swipe from right to left, click the drop-down arrow next to the **Right** option and select **New window**.

 The mouse gesture feature has two other options: **Show Mouse Track** and **Show Action Hint**. The first option shows the path of your mouse movement, and the second option provides visual cues for gesture-based actions.

 You can also use the **Reset all gestures** option to restore all the gestures to their default settings.
