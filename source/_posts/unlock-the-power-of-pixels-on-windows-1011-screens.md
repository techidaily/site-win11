## Unlock the Power of Pixels on Windows 10/11 Screens

 There are many third-party apps with which you can annotate screenshots. However, there are far fewer annotation tools that enable users to draw directly on the Windows desktop.

 Epic Pen and gInk are two apps that enable you to seamlessly scribble on the Windows desktop and software as you would on a drawing board. This is how you can draw on the Windows 10 and 11 desktop with those apps.

## How to Draw on the Windows Desktop With Epic Pen

 Epic Pen is freemium software with limited functionality. The free version enables you to scribble on the screen in Windows 11/10, 8, and 7 with its pen and highlighter. However, tools for adding shapes, straight lines, and text are only available in Epic Pen Pro. You can download and install the basic Epic Pen software like this:

1. Open the[Epic Pen](https://epicpen.com/) website.
2. Click the**Download For Free** button to scroll down the homepage.
3. Select the**Download Epic Pen** option for the free version.
4. Find and double-click the**Epic Pen Setup v3.11.44.exe** file in whatever folder your browser usually downloads to.
5. Select**English** (or another preferred language) on the drop-down menu and click**OK** .
6. Deselect the**Start Epic Pen on Windows login** setting if you prefer the software not to be included within the startup, and click the installer’s**Next** option.

7. Select**I don’t want to use Epic Pen Pro right now** on the activation window to utilize the software without trial features. You can still activate the trial features later.  
![The I don't want to use Epic Pen Pro right now option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/epic-pen-setup-window.jpg)

## How to Draw on the Windows Desktop With gInk

 The gInk app is an open-source alternative to Epic Pen you can utilize for on-screen annotations in Windows 11/10 much the same. This is also a portable app for which no installation is needed. However, you’ll still need to download and extract the gInk archive like this:

1. Open the[gInk page](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Others/gInk.shtml) on Softpedia.
2. Press the**Download** button to bring up a couple of location options. Pick the one closest to your location and download the file.
3. Next, you’ll need to extract gInk’s ZIP file. Follow the guidelines in our article about[how to unzip files on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/unzip-files-windows-10/) to extract the ZIP archive.  
![The Extract Compressed tool](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/extract-compressed-window3.jpg)
4. Double-click**gInk.exe** inside the extracted gInk folder to launch the desktop drawing tool.

 Now you can try out the gInk on-screen drawing (or annotation) tool in Windows. Click the**Pen 1** option, and scribble on the desktop by holding the**left mouse button** and moving the cursor. You can also select three other pen options for different colors.

![The qInk toolbar](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/qink-toolbar.jpg)

 The fifth pen is a transparent highlighter option. Click**Pen 5** to activate the tool’s highlighter. You can utilize this tool for highlighting things in presentations.

 You can adjust the drawing tool’s widths by selecting**Pen width** . Drag the slider along the bar to increase or decrease the width of your pen.

![The pen width bar](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pen-width-option.jpg)

 The gInk toolbar includes a screenshot tool you can use for taking snapshots of what you’ve drawn on the desktop. Click the**Snapshot** (camera) button on the app’s toolbar to activate it. Drag the rectangle around an area to include in the captured output to take the picture. That snapshot will automatically save to a folder path specified within gInk’s**General** tab.

 The gInk app includes five pens on its toolbar by default, but you can add four more. To do so, you’ll need to close gInk’s toolbar first by clicking its**Exit** drawing option. Then right-click the gInk system tray icon and select**Options** .

 Click the**Pens** tab on the**Options** window, and select the checkboxes for additional pens. You can also configure the pens’ colors and widths from that tab by clicking the palette boxes and**Width** drop-down menus for them.
