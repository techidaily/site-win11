## How to Turn Off Notifications When They Pop Up

 Notifications can appear anytime on your Windows PC. When Microsoft Store apps like Spotify or Sudoku get installed, or when apps get an update. Even the Snipping Tool app notifies you when it saves a screenshot.

 You can turn off such unwanted notifications when they pop up to prevent future disturbances. Here's how:

1. Usually, a notification appears on the bottom left of your PC screen for a few seconds—like the installation notification for the**Sudoku** Microsoft Store app in the screenshot below. When this happens, click on the**three-dots Settings menu** on the top.  
![Sudoku App Notification Pops Up on the Screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sudoku-app-notification.jpg)
2. From the**Settings** options, click**Turn off all notifications for Microsoft Store** —as you can see in the screenshot below.  
![Turn Off All Notifications Option in Settings Menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/turn-off-notifications-on-pop-up.jpg)  
 All Microsoft Store applications will stop. Likewise, if it's another app, you will no longer get any notifications from it.
3. Maybe you miss turning off a notification when it appears. But this notification banner will show up in the Notification Center. So open the Notification Center by pressing**Win + N** keys together or clicking on the date and time in the taskbar.
4. When you see one or more notification banners, hover over the top of the notification. The**three-dots Settings menu** will appear.

5. Click on this**three-dots menu** and select**Turn off all notifications for Snipping Tool** , as you see in the screenshot below, or for any other app sending notifications.

 To clear all notifications from the Notification Center, click the**Clear all** button at the top.

## How to Turn Off All Notifications at Once

 When attending to a pressing task, you would want no disturbances. Not even one notification distracting you. To achieve that, you can turn off all notifications at once in Windows 11.

1. Open**Windows Settings** by pressing the**Win + I** keys together.
2. Select**Notifications** under the**System** page.  
![Notifications Selected in System Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/select-notifications-in-settings-1.jpg)
3. Turn off the**Notifications toggle** at the top of the**Notifications** page.
