## Optimize Context Selection by Omitting Show More

 Windows 11 comes with a fresh new look and has mainly got a positive response for its new interface. However, there are a couple of features that are not being welcomed by the users. For instance, the addition of the "show more options" entry to the right-click context menu.

 Although it was introduced to simplify things, many users still prefer the old context menu from Windows 10\. Fortunately, you can remove Show more options from the context menu on Windows 11 by following the below methods.

## 1\. How to Remove "Show More Options" From the Context Menu With Folder Options

 The[Windows Folder Options](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-folder-options-guide/) in File Explorer is the go-to place to view and manage File Explorer settings. You can use it to[enable compact view in File Explorer on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-enable-compact-view-windows-11-file-explorer/) , manage file thumbnails, remove the "show more options" entry, and much more.

 Here's how to use the folder option to remove the "show more options" entry from the context menu:

1. Press the**Win + E** hotkey to open the**File Explorer.**
2. Click the three horizontal dots at the top bar and choose**Options.**
3. In the**Folder Options,** switch to the**View** tab.
4. Check the**Launch folder** **windows in a separate process** box.

5. Click**Apply** \>**OK** to save the changes.

Next, restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

## 2\. Remove Show More Options From the Context Menu Using the Command Prompt

 If you're a power user, you can use Command Prompt to remove the "show more options" entry from the context menu. Here's how:

1. Open the**Start Menu** by pressing the**Win** key.
2. In the search bar, type**Command Prompt** and choose**Run as administrator** from the right pane.
3. Click**Yes** to the UAC that crops up.
4. In the elevated Command Prompt window, type the following command and press**Enter** :  
`reg add "HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID\{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2}\InprocServer32" /f /ve`

![Command to Remove Context menu in Command Prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/command-to-remove-context-menu.jpg)

 After executing the command, you'll see the "The operation completed successfully" message to confirm that it went through.

 Now, you will have to restart Windows Explorer to see the changes. To do that, open the**Task Manager** (see how to[launch the Task Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-open-task-manager-windows-10/) ), right-click on**Windows Explorer,** and choose**Restart.**

 Check if you can see the changes. If not, then you will have to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

 In the future, if you want to add the "show more options" entry to the context menu, then open Command Prompt with admin rights and run the following command:

`reg delete "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID\{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2}" /f​`

## 3\. Remove Show More Options From the Context Menu Using the Registry Editor

 Another quick way to remove the "show more options" entry is through the Registry Editor. Here's what you need to do:

 Before making any changes to the registry, ensure you've[created a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) or[back up the registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) . This will ensure your system settings and files are secure, and you can quickly access them if something goes wrong.

1. Open the Start Menu, type**Registry Editor** in the search bar, and press Enter.
2. In the Registry Editor, navigate to the following location:  
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID`
3. Right-click on the empty space on the right pane, click**New,** and then select**DWORD** **(32-bit) Value** from the context menu.
4. Name the value as**"UndockingDisabled"** and press**Enter** .

5. Double-click on the UndockingDisabled key, type**1** in the**Value data,** and click**OK** to save the changes.

## Enjoy an Old School Context Menu on Windows 11
