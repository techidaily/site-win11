## 1\. Turn Off Scroll Lock

 A common reason why you may be unable to scroll in Microsoft Excel is if you have inadvertently enabled the Scroll Lock feature. To turn it off, right-click on the status bar at the bottom and click the **Scroll Lock** option to uncheck it.

 You can also disable Scroll Lock on Windows using your keyboard. The **Scroll Lock** (or **ScrLk**) key is typically located in the upper right corner of the keyboard. Pressing this key will deactivate Scroll Lock and allow you to scroll through your Excel spreadsheet again.

 If you can’t find the Scroll Lock key on your physical keyboard, [use the on-screen keyboard on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-on-screen-keyboard-type-smarter/) to disable Scroll Lock. For that, press **Win + S** to access the search menu, type **osk** in the search box, and hit **Enter**. Then, click the **ScrLk** key to disable Scroll Lock.

## 2\. Unfreeze Panes

 Microsoft Excel allows you to freeze specific parts of the sheet so that they remain visible even as you scroll through the sheet. This might create the false impression that your Excel sheet isn’t scrolling correctly. To avoid any confusion, you can unfreeze panes in your worksheet by following the steps below.

1. Open up your Excel worksheet.
2. Click the **View** tab at the top.
3. Click the **Freeze Panes** option.
4. Select **Unfreeze Panes** from the resulting menu.

 Following this, your Excel spreadsheet should scroll as expected.

1. Open Microsoft Excel on your PC.
2. Click the **File** menu in the top left corner.
3. Select **Options** from the left sidebar.
4. In the Excel Options window, switch to the **Advanced** tab.
5. Clear the **Zoom on roll with IntelliMouse** checkbox.
6. Click **OK** to save the changes.

## 6\. Update Microsoft Excel

 By default, Microsoft Office tends to install newer updates automatically on your Windows computer.

This can result in all kinds of issues, including the one discussed here. Hence, it’s a good idea to update Microsoft Excel on your PC.

1. Open Microsoft Excel and click the **File** menu in the top left corner.
2. Select **Account** from the left sidebar.
3. Click **Update Options > Update Now**.  
![Update Microsoft Excel](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/update-microsoft-excel.jpg)
