## 3\. Clean Up Your Disk Drive

 The solution, in this case, is to[free up disk space in your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/6-tips-free-disk-space-windows-10/) . One way to do that is by cleaning the drive containing the Windows 11 OS, which is C: drive for most users.

 That's it. You have gained some space in the OS drive. If you want to create more space, you can remove unnecessary folders from the OS drive.

This folder is automatically created whenever you upgrade from Windows 10 to 11.

 There's no harm in deleting this folder, but make sure you only do it when you have no plans to return to Windows 10.

 The update errors often result due to corruption in the Windows Update components. To detect and remove the corruption, you will have to reset the Windows Update components. Here's how:

1. In the Start menu, type**Command Prompt** and choose**Run as administrator** from the right pane.
2. In the console, type these four separate commands and press Enter after each:  
`net stop bits  
net stop wuauserv  
net stop appidsvc  
net stop cryptsvc`
3. Type the following command and press Enter to rename the SoftwareDistribution folder:  
`Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old`
4. Then, execute this command to rename the catroot2 folder:  
`Ren %systemroot%\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old`
5. Now, to restart the services, execute these four commands separately:  
`net start bits  
net start wuauserv  
net start appidsvc  
net start cryptsvc`

 After that, restart your computer and check whether you can update Windows 11 again.
