## Chrome Alert Disabling: Windows Edition Tips

 Although Google Chrome notifications keep you up to date on the latest news, emails, messages, and more, irrelevant notifications from websites can get annoying very fast.

 Thankfully, it's quite easy to disable Google Chrome notifications on Windows. You can either block Chrome notifications for a few specific websites or turn them off entirely. In this post, we’ll show you how to do both.

## How to Turn Off Google Chrome Notifications From Windows Settings

 The Windows Settings app lets you enable or[disable notifications for each of your apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/selectively-disable-app-notifications-windows-10/) separately. If you do not want to receive any notifications from Google Chrome, you can disable its notification permission on Windows. Here's how you can go about it.

1. Open the Start menu and click the gear icon or use the**Win + I** keyboard shortcut to[launch the Settings app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) .
2. Navigate to**System > Notifications** .
3. Scroll down to the**Notifications from apps and other senders** section.

1. Open Google Chrome on your PC.
2. Click the**menu icon** in the top right corner to open**Settings** .
3. Navigate to **Privacy and security > Site Settings > Notifications** .
4. Click the**Add** button next to**Not allowed to send notifications** .
