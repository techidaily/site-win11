## 1\. Install Microsoft PowerToys From the Microsoft Store

 Microsoft Store is an online marketplace pre-installed on Windows. It offers a diverse array of free and paid apps, games, and even device updates, all in one place. This gives Windows users access to everything they need under one roof.

 To install Microsoft PowerToys from the Microsoft Store, follow these steps:

1. Press **Win + Q** and type **Microsoft Store** in the search bar.
2. Click on the **Microsoft Store** icon in the search results.
3. On the Microsoft Store page, search for **PowerToys**. The next page will provide a detailed overview of the software package. Please read it carefully before continuing.
4. If you feel satisfied, click **Install** to begin the downloading & installation process. The process might take a few minutes.

 Once installation is complete, open the Microsoft PowerToys app from the Start menu. All features are ready to use.

## 2\. Install Microsoft PowerToys From the GitHub Page

 If you don't have access to the Microsoft Store, you can also download and install Microsoft PowerToys from the GitHub page.

 To install Microsoft PowerToys from GitHub, do the following:

1. [Visit the official Microsoft PowerToys GitHub page](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) and navigate to the **Releases** section. It's usually on the right side of the page.
2. In the Releases section, click on the most recent stable version. It should be at the top and have the word **Latest** beside it.

3. Now look for a file that is named something like **PowerToysSetup-0.##.#-x64.exe**. Here, the **#** represents the version number. Click on this file to start the download. After that, navigate to your downloads folder and double-click on it. This will start the installation process.

4. A window might pop up asking for permission to change your device. Click **Yes** to continue. The setup wizard will then open. Here, follow the installation prompts. Typically, you just need to click **Next** a few times and then **Install**.
5. Once the installation process is completed, you'll be prompted to finish and exit the setup. Click **Finish**. You might be asked to agree to terms and conditions, choose an installation location, and decide whether you want a shortcut created.
