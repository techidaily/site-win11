## Why Is High on Life Crashing?

![screenshot of high on life files](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/screenshot_of_high_on_life_files.jpg)

 High on Life runs on Unreal Engine 5\. While[Unreal Engine 5 will change the future of gaming](https://www.makeuseof.com/unreal-engine-5-change-gaming-reasons-why/) , it's also being prone to crashing on certain hardware or software configurations.

 Thankfully, it's mostly understood why these crashes are occurring and how we can possibly fix them.

## 1\. Check Your Hardware: How Many Sticks of RAM Do You Have?

![screenshot of RAM monitor in task manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/screenshot_of_ram_monitor_task_manager.jpg)

 Users have reported that High on Life runs into issues if their system only has one stick of RAM.

 It doesn't matter if it's a large or small amount on that single stick, it seems High on Life is a little more prone to crashing on one stick rather than multiple.

 It's unknown what causes this error, or if it will be patched. Check our guide on[how to check your installed RAM](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-check-installed-ram-available-ram-slots/) if you're unsure.

## 3\. Revert High on Life's Day One Patch

![screenshot of high on life steam depot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/screenshot_of_high_on_life_steam_depot.jpg)

 High on Life received a day-one patch on consoles, though that same patch was delayed on PC. This means some users played the game without the day one patch, and only started to crash after it was applied.

 While there is a chance of additional patches further fixing crashing issues, you could downgrade the game to the original release version and see if playing without the patch helps. To do that, you'll need to[learn how to downgrade a Steam game](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-downgrade-steam-games/) .

## Getting High on Life Running Again

 Games running on Unreal can crash for any number of reasons, but the engine is versatile and, in most cases, easy to fix. With any luck, there will be further patches to improve the performance of this game.
