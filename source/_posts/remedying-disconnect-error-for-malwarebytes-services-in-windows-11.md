## Remedying Disconnect Error for Malwarebytes Services in Windows 11

 Malwarebytes is one of the more highly rated antimalware software for Windows. So, it’s a pity when some users can’t utilize Malwarebytes because of an error message that says "unable to connect the Service." Some users have reported seeing that error message when they try to open Malwarebytes.

 Users who’ve purchased the premium version of Malwarebytes will be particularly annoyed by this issue. Are you also stumped by Malwarebytes’ "unable to connect" error? If you are, this is how you can fix the "unable to connect the service" error for MalwareBytes in Windows 10 and 11.

## 1\. Set Malwarebytes to Run as an Administrator

 First, try applying simpler potential solutions, such as running Malwarebytes as an administrator. This will at least ensure the software has full system permissions when you start it.

 Our guide for[always running apps as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/always-run-apps-administrator-windows/) explains how you can apply this potential fix.

## 2\. Check That the Malwarebytes Service Is Enabled and Running

 The Malwarebytes Service is needed for the Malwarebytes software to run properly. The "unable to connect the service" error message may occur if this service isn't running. So, check that the Malwarebytes Service is enabled and running as follows:

1. Activate the Run command box with the**Win + R** hotkey.
2. Type**services.msc** in the**Open** box and select**OK** to launch Services.
3. Double-click**Malwarebytes Services** to access that service’s properties window.

6. Click the service’s**Apply** and**OK** options.

## 3\. Check That the Windows Management Instrumentation Is Enabled and Running

 Many software packages need the Windows Management Instrumentation Service enabled to function correctly. So, check that the Windows Management Instrumentation service is set to**Automatic** and running as well.

 Open Services (see[how to open Services on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-services-app/) ). double-click**Windows Management Instrumentation** , and select its**Automatic** and**Start** option from there as outlined for the second resolution.
