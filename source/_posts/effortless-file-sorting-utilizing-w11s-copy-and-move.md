## Effortless File Sorting: Utilizing W11’s Copy and Move

 macOS has a native "New Folder with Selection" context menu option which automatically bundles all selected files into a new folder. It's a convenient two-in-one option for creating a folder and moving selected files into it. It’s a pity Windows 11 doesn’t have a similar context menu option.

 However, you can add this feature to Windows 11’s context menu with Files 2 Folder and TeraCopy. Both software packages add context menu options for putting selected files into new folders. This is how you can put selected files into new folders in Windows 11\.

## How to Place Selected Files Into a New Folder With Files 2 Folder

 Files 2 Folder is little more than a shell extension that adds a new option to Windows 11’s classic context menu. Selecting **Files 2 Folder** on the context menu brings up a window with four options for moving the selected files into a new directory.

 You can place selected files into a new folder with Files 2 Folder as follows:

1. Open the [Files 2 Folder webpage](https://www.dcmembers.com/skwire/download/files-2-folder/) in your web browser and download it.
2. Double-click the **Files2Folder.exe** file.
3. Select **Yes** to register the shell extension.

4. Now bring up a directory that includes some files with which to create a new folder.
5. Select files to include in your new folder.
6. Then right-click a selected file and select **Show more options** and **Files 2 Folder** on the classic context menu.

7. Input a folder name within the text for the **Move all selected items into a subfolder named** option.

8. Click **OK** to create the new folder with the files selected moved into it. The new folder will be in the directory where you selected the files.

 You can also select one of three alternative folder creation options within the Files 2 Folder window. The **Move each file to individual subfolders based on their names** option does what its label says. Or create a dated directory by selecting **Move all selected files to a date folder**.

 If you need to organize selected files according to format, select **Move each file to subfolders based on their file extensions**.

## Add a Handy New Folder Creation Option to Windows 11’s Context Menu

 macOS' folder creation option is a lifesaver, and it's a shame Windows doesn't have it by default. We can only be grateful for TeraCopy and Files 2 Folders enabling us to utilize the same feature on Windows 11, and we can only hope Windows 12 adds it by default.

 However, you can add this feature to Windows 11’s context menu with Files 2 Folder and TeraCopy. Both software packages add context menu options for putting selected files into new folders. This is how you can put selected files into new folders in Windows 11\.
