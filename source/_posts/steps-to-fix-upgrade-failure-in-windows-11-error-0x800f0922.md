 This error appears when users try to download the 2022-04 Cumulative update for Windows 11\. For most users, this error occurs the next moment after initiating the update. For others, it appears after 98% of the update has been downloaded.

 The error mainly appears when important Windows update services are not running in the background, or your computer doesn't have enough space to install the update. Also, corruption in the SoftwareDistribution folder can be a prime reason behind the error.

## 1\. Restart Your Device

 Whenever you face any Windows issues, including the update error 0x800f0922, your first port of call should be to restart the computer. Restarting the computer will reset all the memory caches and processes, which might be the reason behind the error.

## 2\. Use the Windows Update Troubleshooter

[Windows 11 features lots of integrated troubleshooters](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-troubleshooters/) which come in handy in different scenarios. To get rid of update errors, you can use the Windows Update troubleshooter.

 The troubleshooter will clear the Windows Update-related temporary files and repair the corrupt Windows Update components. Here's how to run the Windows Update troubleshooter on Windows 11:

1. Open the**Settings menu** by pressing the**Win + I** hotkeys and choose the**Troubleshoot** option.
2. Select**Other troubleshooters.**

## 3\. Clean Up Your Disk Drive

 Your computer must have enough space to download and install the Windows updates. If this isn't the case, you will likely face different issues, including the update error 0x800f0922.

 The solution, in this case, is to[free up disk space in your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/6-tips-free-disk-space-windows-10/) . One way to do that is by cleaning the drive containing the Windows 11 OS, which is C: drive for most users.

5. Click the**Delete Files** option in the prompt that crops up.

 That's it. You have gained some space in the OS drive. If you want to create more space, you can remove unnecessary folders from the OS drive.

 For instance, you can[delete old Windows update files](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/delete-old-windows-update-files/) like the Windows.old folder, which contains data of the OS version previously installed on your computer.

net stop wuauserv  
net stop appidsvc  
net stop cryptsvc`
3. Type the following command and press Enter to rename the SoftwareDistribution folder:  
`Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old`
4. Then, execute this command to rename the catroot2 folder:  
`Ren %systemroot%\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old`
5. Now, to restart the services, execute these four commands separately:  
`net start bits  
net start wuauserv  
net start appidsvc  
net start cryptsvc`

 After that, restart your computer and check whether you can update Windows 11 again.
