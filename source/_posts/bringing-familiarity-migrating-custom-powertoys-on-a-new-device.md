## How to Back Up Your PowerToys Settings

 Transferring settings from one installation of PowerToys to another works best if both versions are the same. You can check the version in the General tab of the app. If required, update PowerToys to the latest version, and install/update the same version on the second PC.

1. Open PowerToys and check all of your settings are as you want them.
2. Select the**General** tab and scroll to the bottom of the options list to find**Backup & Restore** .
3. Click the small arrow to view the current backup location. You can change this by clicking the folder icon.
4. When you have set the backup location, click the**Backup** button.

 The backup of your PowerToys settings has now been saved to your chosen folder. If you change a setting and click backup again, a new backup file will be created alongside the first.

 PowerToys is updated regularly, with new features like [File Locksmith](https://www.makeuseof.com/powertoys-file-locksmith-guide/) added from time to time. Your backups are dated, so you can create a new one each time a tool is added and still be able to recognize the backup.
