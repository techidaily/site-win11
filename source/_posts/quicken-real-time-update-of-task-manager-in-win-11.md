## Quicken Real-Time Update of Task Manager in Win 11

 One of the most important functions of the Task Manager is finding out how your Windows 11 computer is performing in real-time. If you’re running Windows 11 Build 22557 or later, you’ll have access to the new Task Manager’s design. And this makes it easier to change its real-time update speed.

## What Is the Task Manager's Real-Time Update Speed?

 The real-time update feature of the Task Manager shows the status of the apps, background processes, and services on your PC, and the impact they have on its hardware resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage drive, in real-time.

 And the real-time update speed is the frequency at which the Task Manager updates the data mentioned above.

 For more information on what the Task Manager is capable of, please read our guide on [how to use the Task Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-windows-task-manager/) .

You can set the real-time update speed to any of the below options:

* **Normal** : Updates once every second.
* **High** : Updates every half a second or two times per second.
* **Low** : Updates every four seconds.
* **Paused** : Suspends all real-time updates.

Now let’s look at how you can choose the speed you want.
