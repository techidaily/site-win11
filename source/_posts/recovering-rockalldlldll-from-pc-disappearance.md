## 3\. Check Your PC for Malware

 Are abrupt errors a regular occurrence on your PC, or is the rockalldll.dll error the first time you’ve encountered something like this? If you believe errors like this are a recurrence, then it's possible that your PC might be infected by[malware](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-malware-and-how-does-it-work/) . So giving your PC a quick malware scan will help ensure everything is ship-shape.

Here’s how you can get started:

1. Press**Win + I** to open your Windows settings. Alternatively, head to the**Start menu** search bar, type in ‘settings,’ and select the**Best Match** .
2. Head to**Privacy & security > Windows Security** .
3. Click on**Open Windows Security** .
4. Now, select**Virus & threat protection** and click on**Quick scan** .

![virus and threat protection](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/virus-and-threat-protection.jpg)

 Windows Security will begin scanning your PC for malware. Since this is a quick scan, you won’t have to wait too long. If it finds any viruses, it will remove them instantly and fix the rockalldll.dll error most probably as well.

 Before we jump to the next method below, though, we’d also encourage you to run a deep scan from time to time. While it's true that it will take more time than a regular, quick scan, the positives easily trump the seemingly high costs, i.e., a thorough clean-up of your PC for malicious threats.

 The option to do this is on the**Virus & threat protection** page. Click on**Scan options** and select either the**Full Scan** or**Microsoft Defender Scan** option. If you’re still on the fence about the complete scan, go through our[Windows Security guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-quick-security-guide/) to get a complete picture.

## 4\. Reinstall the Troublesome Program

 Reinstalling the program also tends to help sometimes. Whether it's a game or something else, if none of the above methods have worked so far, then removing the program and installing it again is worth a shot.

## 5\. Run an SFC or CHDSK Scan

 The System File Checker (SFC) tool is a free utility designed to look for and fix corrupted Windows files, including important DLL files. While it doesn't guarantee a fix, a quick SFC scan may be all

 you need to get rid of the “rockalldll.dll not found” error.

 To perform a scan, check out our guide on[how to run the System File Checker tool on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/) . The SFC tool will start scanning your system for all errors it can find. If it finds any errors, it’ll usually try to fix them right then and there.

 If that doesn't find anything, CHDSK is also an excellent tool to get your PC fixed when it's plagued with random errors. It works by scanning your entire drive to find and fix any errors in files and the file system itself. To run CHDSK, we’ll make use of the Command Prompt in elevated mode. Here’s how:

1. Head to the**Start menu** search bar, type in ‘cmd,’ right-click on the top result. Select**Run as administrator** .
2. In the cmd, type in the following command and hit**Enter** :  
`chkdsk c:`
3. ![chkdsk cmd](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/chkdsk-cmd.jpg)  
 In the above command, we’re scanning the**C** drive. If you want to check another drive, change "C" with the desired drive's letter.

 The scan will be completed in a few seconds, and hopefully, along with it, the "Rockalldll.dll missing error" will be gone as well.
