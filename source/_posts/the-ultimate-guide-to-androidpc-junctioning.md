## The Ultimate Guide to Android/PC Junctioning

 When you sync your Android with Windows, you get a host of decentralizing benefits, such as the ability to share your data or control across multiple devices or nodes, protection from single points of failure, etc.

 In practical terms, you can make phone calls, read and send text messages, get notifications, and more—straight from your PC. So let’s look at all the different ways to connect your Android to a Windows PC.

## How to Sync Your Android With Windows

 Interestingly, there's a vast diversity of ways to record your files on Windows. In fact, there are more than a few ways to do this: Phone Link app, Unison app, and even third-party apps like AirDroid are a few examples.

 Let’s look over them all one by one.

### 1\. Phone Link

 Phone Link, formerly Your Phone, is a free Windows app from Microsoft that lets you connect your Windows 10 or Windows 11 to Androids or iOS devices. Although [there are ways Microsoft can improve Phone Link](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-microsoft-improve-phone-link-windows-11/), the [Phone Link app still offers a myriad of features that make it a pleasure to use](<http://Phone> Link app still offers a myriad of features), such as:

* Feature to make and receive calls from your PC.
* Receive and manage your mobile notifications.
* File transfer between PC and your smartphone.
* Read and reply to messages straight from your PC.

 Given the above and similar features, installing and using it to connect your Windows to Android makes sense. To get started, we ask you to [go through our Phone Link guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-your-phone-app-guide/) to learn how to connect your Android with a Windows PC.

### 2\. Intel Unison

 Just like the Phone Link, Intel Unison is specifically designed to help you connect your Android or iOS devices to a Windows PC. Install the app, and you can then move your files and images between devices, receive notifications, and respond to text messages with ease.

 Both Phone Link and Intel Unison are pretty much similar in their functionalities; the only noticeable difference is perhaps their integrations—while Phone Link has more features and integration for Microsoft products, Intel Unison is geared more towards Intel users. To start with Intel Unison, follow our [short guide on syncing Android and Windows devices with Intel Unison](https://www.makeuseof.com/sync-android-ios-device-windows-11-intel-unison/).

### 3\. AirDroid Cast

 AirDroid Cast is a popular app on the web. Many people use it for all kinds of things—from remotely controlling your Android from a PC to real-time screen sharing, AirDroid Cast supports it all.

**Step 1: Download AirDroid Cast**

 To get started with AirDroid Cast, first download the AirDroid Cast app on your Android from PlayStore, and the Windows app from the official AirDroid website.

**Step 2: Create an account**

 After downloading the app, it’s time to create or sign in to your AirDroid account. Launch the AirDroid Cast app on your phone and Windows, and create a new account if you don’t have one already. From there, sign in to your account.

**Step 3: Connect the apps**

 Launch the app on both your Windows and Android. Now, scan the QR code on your Windows versions of the AirDroid Cast app from your AirDroid Cast app on Android. You’ll get a confirmation notification.

 Click on **Allow** to go ahead with the connection. As soon you do this, your Android screen will get mirrored on the Windows versions of the AirDroid Cast app.

 Also, note that to get features like AirPlay Service and Remote Casting, you will have to choose the Remote Casting app, which comes to about $2.49/month. Similarly, the Control Android device feature only comes with the third plan, which will cost you $3.49/month.

## Syncing AirDroid With a Windows PC

 You don’t have to pull out your Android smartphone every time you have to call, message, or check some notification. Instead, you can do that straight from your Windows through the right syncing app. This is also true for the opposite by the way, where you might have to control your PC remotely through Android.

 In practical terms, you can make phone calls, read and send text messages, get notifications, and more—straight from your PC. So let’s look at all the different ways to connect your Android to a Windows PC.
