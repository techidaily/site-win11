## 1\. Check the Network Adapter Status

 Device Manager on Windows makes it easy to view, manage, and update various hardware devices connected to your system. You can use it to examine the status of your network adapter and check if it is encountering any particular errors.

 Here's how you can go about checking the status of your network adapter on Windows.

1. Right-click the **Start icon** or use the **Win + X** keyboard shortcut to open the Power User menu.
2. Select **Device Manager** from the list.
3. Expand **Network adapters**.
4. Right-click on your network adapter and select **Properties**.
5. Select the **General** tab.
6. Check the message under **Device status**.  
![Check Network Adapter Status in Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/check-network-adapter-status-in-windows.jpg)

 If you see an error under **Device status**, write it down and then look for solutions to fix that particular error first.

 Is the network adapter entry missing from the Device Manager? If so, you can ask Windows to scan your system's hardware again. To do so, click the **Action** menu in the Device Manager window and select **Scan for hardware changes**.

 Wait for the Device Manager window to detect the network adapter, and then check its status using the steps mentioned above.

## 2\. Run the Network Adapter Troubleshooter

 Your Windows computer comes equipped with a variety of troubleshooters designed to automatically identify and resolve issues. In this case, you can run the Network Adapter troubleshooter to scan your system for any irregularities and fix them.

 To run the network adapter troubleshooter, use these steps:

1. Press **Win + I** to open the Settings app.
2. In the **System** tab, click on **Troubleshoot**.
3. Select **Other troubleshooters**.
4. Click the **Run** button next to the **Network Adapter**.

2. Type **devmgmt.msc** in the text box and press **Enter** to open the Device Manager.
3. Expand **Network adapters**.

 Windows will now check if any updates are available for your drivers and download them.

 If the problem persists even after updating the network adapter driver, it is likely that the driver is corrupted. In that case, you will need to uninstall the driver from your PC.

 If you need help with that, check out [how to uninstall drivers in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-uninstall-drivers/). After removing the driver, restart your PC, and Windows will automatically reinstall the missing driver during boot.

 You can try resetting the Winsock data on your PC to see if that restores normalcy. To do so, use these steps:

1. Press **Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type **Windows PowerShell** in the text box and select **Run as administrator**.
3. Select **Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
