## Cutting Down Unnecessary Workload in Windows System

 The Windows operating system is huge, with many apps, processes, and services running simultaneously. These apps may not be visible to you in the desktop view, but you only need to open the task manager to discover many running background processes.

 These processes are a major culprit when investigating why your PC runs slow and has long loading times. Most of these processes don’t need to run all the time, if at all. To that end, we have compiled a list of methods of disabling background processes, so you can give your PC a significant speed boost.

## Why Do Background Processes Appear?

 Background processes are mini-programs that perform a specific task on your computer. They run without user input and are designed to complement other programs. These programs monitor your system, schedule updates, run backups, and provide other essential services.

 As you install more software, you add more background processes to those preinstalled on your Windows OS. Despite their obvious benefits, these background processes don’t need to run at all times. Yet, they do, taking up precious memory, draining processing power, and reducing battery life.

 Background processes tend to accumulate over time. They’re a major contributor to the decline in your PC’s speed. Hence, it’s vital that you properly manage background processes and enable them only when they’re needed.

## Background Processes You Should Never Kill

 Terminating Windows processes can cause programs not to function correctly or even [crash your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/top-reasons-why-your-computer-keeps-crashing/). These programs are indispensable to the smooth operation of your system, so you should never kill them unless you’re an expert.

 Microsoft processes are equally just as important. While they’re not directly involved in the operating system, they manage the preinstalled apps shipped with the OS. Disabling these processes adversely affects utility apps like Settings, Windows Defender, and Microsoft Office.

 Finally, you should avoid disabling processes related to the various hardware devices on your computer. These processes complement the drivers for these devices and may help them communicate with the operating system.

## How to Fix Too Many Background Processes on Windows

 Now that you know which background processes are important for your computer let’s discuss how to remove unwanted apps and clean up background processes.

### 1\. Manually Kill Processes Using Task Manager

 You can free up your system resources by [force-closing any running applications](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-kill-unresponsive-programs-without-the-task-manager/) that consume a lot of memory. Before using this method, ensure you’re not actively using the running application. In addition, remember not to end Microsoft processes.

 To begin, open the [Windows Task Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-task-manager/) by pressing **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** or **Win + X.** Then, navigate to the **Processes** tab, right-click on it, and ensure that the **Memory** section is checked. This would sort the applications in the order of their memory consumption.

 Select the application you want to close and click the **End Task** button at the bottom-right of the menu. You can also right-click on the application and select **End Task** in the context menu that appears.

![Ending a Process on Task Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/EndTask.jpg)

 The best kind of processes to disable using this method is system tray apps and services, such as Discord, Slack, and antivirus programs. These programs always run in the background and never close, even if you quit their main application window. Consequently, they contribute to the numerous background processes you often see in Task Manager.

### 2\. Disable Startup Processes

 As the name implies, startup processes begin running as soon as you boot your Windows PC. These programs are often responsible for your computer’s long startup times and run in the background even when unused.

 To reduce the number of startup processes, open the Task Manager and click on the **Startup** tab to open its menu. You will find a list of all startup processes and their enabled status here. Right-click on any process you want to disable and select the **Disable** option in the context menu.

![Disabling Startup Processes on Task Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/StartupProcesses.jpg)

 Alternatively, you can use the Disable button on the bottom-right of the menu. All Microsoft processes in this menu are safe to disable because they are non-critical for your PC. Furthermore, you can use [Autoruns to manage your startup programs](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-startup-programs-autoruns/).

### 3\. Remove Third-Party Processes

 Third-party processes are enabled when you install external software on your computer. They don’t have a user interface and run entirely in the background. Much like startup processes, these programs run as you boot your PC.

 You can disable these processes by opening the Task Manager and clicking on the drop-down beside the desired application. Select the **Open Services** option to launch the Services program.

![Open Services Dialog box on Start Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/OpenServices.jpg)

 Within this program, look for the third-party service you want to disable, right-click on it, and select **properties**. This will open the properties menu for that service. Click on the **Startup type** drop-down and select the **Disabled** option. Hit **Apply**, then **OK** to close the window.

### 4\. Free Up System Resources Using System Configuration

 Removing third-party processes one after the other can get tiresome. Fortunately, there’s a faster method to disable these processes in bulk.

 Press the **Win + R** keys to launch the **Run** app. Next, type in **msconfig** in the text box and hit **Enter**. Next, select the **Services** tab and ensure the **Hide all Microsoft services** checkbox is ticked. Click the **Disable all** button, then **Apply** and **OK.**

 The [System Configuration utility](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-msconfig-guide/) will prompt you to restart your PC. Click **Restart** to effect your changes.

### 5\. Turn Off System Monitors

 System monitors examine your computer to collect resource usage and performance stats. They operate within your computer and consume system resources themselves. Microsoft includes system monitors with your Windows OS, which you must never turn off.

 However, some third-party applications also embed system monitors within their installation packages. They run independently of the parent software and often appear in the notifications tray. Most of these programs don’t appear in the Task Manager and are very difficult to remove.

 Consequently, the best way to eliminate system monitors is to identify and exclude them when installing their parent software. This is another reason you should be careful and equally aware of the dangers of third-party apps.

## How to Prevent the Recurrence of Too Many Background Processes

 Many of the methods discussed earlier are only effective for one session of using your computer. They revert to their original state upon a fresh reboot. Therefore, to permanently prevent background processes from running on your PC, you can try the following methods.

### 1\. Disable Apps from Running in the Background

 Most preinstalled Windows apps from the Microsoft Store run in the background. These apps don’t consume much memory or severely affect performance. Nevertheless, if you want to save as many system resources as possible, you can disable them from running in the background.

 Click on the start menu and select the **Settings** app. Open the **Privacy** menu and choose the **Background apps** section. From the resulting menu, you can prevent your PC from running all background apps or disable apps individually.

### 2\. Uninstall Unwanted Apps

 Given how cheap and easy it is to acquire SSDs and HDDs nowadays, we have enough storage to install programs indiscriminately. Most of these apps have no adverse effects besides taking up storage space. However, some run background processes that can slow down your PC.

 As a result, it would be best to uninstall any applications you’re not using. To remove programs from your PC, open **Settings** **\>** **Apps**. Select any app you want to remove and click the **Uninstall** button.
