## How to Update Your AMD Radeon Graphics Drivers on Windows 11

 AMD is one of the leading chipset and graphic card manufacturers; AMD Radeon graphics are popular due to their incredible performance and reliability. A feat made possible with the help of robust software drivers that seamlessly integrate the AMD hardware with different gaming and other applications on your PC.

 It's essential you keep your Windows 11 AMD Radeon device updated with the latest display and graphics drivers to keep your machine performing optimally. But with so many official and third-party tools available online, it’s often confusing to figure out the best way to update your AMD Radeon device. Fortunately, we’re going to discuss reliable methods you can use to update your Windows 11 AMD Radeon PC safely.

## Do You Need to Update Your AMD Radeon Graphics Driver?

 As with any driver, manufacturers always recommend[updating your drivers to the latest available version](https://www.makeuseof.com/computer-drivers-what-are-they-why-should-you-update/) for greater stability and performance. An outdated faulty graphic card driver can cause performance issues when gaming and streaming and even trigger a Blue Screen of Death.

 If you’re facing graphics-related problems such as video game crashes, rendering issues, or application freezes, you should consider updating your graphics card. A major Windows OS update can also require updating your graphics driver.

 Generally, updating your graphics driver can improve performance, fix known bugs, and even provide a new set of incredible features. It also prevents your Windows from unexpected crashes and brings greater stability.

 However, if you’re not having any issues with your current AMD Radeon graphics driver, you don’t necessarily need to update to the latest version.

## How to Automatically Update Your AMD Radeon Driver

 The best way to install the latest AMD Radeon driver is through the official AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition tool. Once set up, the device automatically detects your current AMD display adapters and graphic cards and downloads the necessary updates (if available).

 To use the AMD Adrenaline Edition tool to update your AMD Radeon Graphics Driver:

1. Note down the model of your installed AMD graphics card by navigating to**Task Manager > Performance > GPU** . In the below screenshot, we’re using the AMD Ryzen 5 - Radeon Vega 8 Graphics card. If you cannot figure it out, choose a random AMD Radeon product in the next step.
