## Overcoming the 0X800704CF Error From Microsoft Store

 Many Microsoft Store users have reported they can’t use the app in both Windows 10 and 11 because of error 0x800704CF. Error 0x800704CF occurs when those users attempt to log into Microsoft Store. Its error message says, “You’ll need the internet for this… 0x800704CF.” This issue arises even when users are connected to the internet and can open web pages.

 Thus, error 0x800704CF is seemingly a Microsoft Store connection issue that renders the app inoperative in Windows 11 and 10\. If you're facing this issue this is how you can resolve error 0x800704CF.

## 1\. Run the Internet Connection and Network Adapters Troubleshooters

 Windows 11 and 10 have a handy collection of troubleshooters that can be a good starting point for fixing many issues. The Internet Connection and Network Adapters troubleshooters could be useful for resolving error 0x800704CF. You can access those troubleshooters via the Control Panel in Windows 11 and 10 as follows:

1. Press**Win + R** at the same time to launch a Run dialog accessory.
2. Input Control Panel in Run and click**OK** .
3. Select the**Large icons** option on Control Panel’s**View by** menu.

7. Click**Next** in those troubleshooters and apply any potential fixes suggested.

 Windows Store App is also a troubleshooting tool that could be useful for addressing error 0x800704CF. That one might fix issues with the Microsoft Store app. So, consider running that troubleshooter as well if the others don't provide a fix.

## 2\. Repair and Reset the Microsoft Store App

## 5\. Disable the Microsoft Network Component Setting Client

 Some users have been able to fix error 0x800704CF by disabling the**Microsoft Network Connection** setting, which is enabled by default.

2. Type input**ncpa.cpl** inside Run.

## 6\. Reinstall the Network Adapter Driver

1. Use one of the many[ways to open Device Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-device-manager/) and expand the**Network adapters** category.
2. Then right-click your PC’s internet network adapter to select an**Uninstall** **device** option for it.  
![The Uninstall device option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/properties-context-menu-option.jpg)
3. Select the**Delete the driver** (or**Attempt to remove the driver**) checkbox.

 To apply this solution, open Command Prompt with admin rights, as outlined in steps one and two of resolution four in this guide. Then execute this command:

`Get-AppXPackage *Microsoft.WindowsStore* | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml&}`

## 8\. Reset Your PC’s Network
