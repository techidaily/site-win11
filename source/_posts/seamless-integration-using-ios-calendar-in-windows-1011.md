## 1\. Apple iCloud

[iCloud](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-icloud/) is an Apple service that keeps all your critical data on the cloud. It stores almost everything that's kept locally on your PC: Contacts, Pages, Reminders, etc.—it’s all there. You'll also find the Calendar app there, of course. So, if you want to access the Calendar app on Windows through iCloud, follow the steps below:

* Head to[iCloud.com](https://www.icloud.com/) and sign in to your Apple account.
* You'll get a sign-in confirmation on your Apple device. Click on**Allow** to go ahead with the sign-in.
* As soon as you click on**Allow** from above, you'll get a verification code. Note it down.
* Now head back to your Windows. You'll see a host of Apple apps here; click on**Calendar** .

 That’s it. Follow the above steps, and you’ll be inside the Calendar web app. You’ll get a view like this:
