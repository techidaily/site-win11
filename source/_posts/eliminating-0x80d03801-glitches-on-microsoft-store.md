 If network problems caused the error code 0x80d03801, you will not see the error anymore.

## 2\. Clear Microsoft Store Cache

 It’s been done to death, and there’s a solid reason why. The cache is where your app or browser stores past search history to help you load things faster next time (And yes, there's a [big difference between cache and cookies](https://www.makeuseof.com/difference-cache-and-cookies/)). However, in some cases, this cache can get corrupted or broken, leading to unexpected errors.

 If your cache has been corrupted, it’s probably causing the error code 0x80d03801 for you right now. So [clearing the cache](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-clear-caches/) of your Microsoft Store app is well worth the try in such cases. Here’s how you can do that:

1. Head to the **Start menu** search bar and type ‘wsreset’.
2. Right-click on the best match and launch it as the administrator.

 Your Microsoft Store’s cache will now reset, and the Microsoft Store will then launch. If a corrupted cache was the reason behind the error code 0x80d03801, this should get rid of it for good.

## 3\. Repair the Microsoft Store App

If your Microsoft Store app has been corrupted, you can give the Windows repair tools a try as well. To repair your app, follow the steps below:

* Press the **Win + I** shortcut to launch the settings app.
* Click on **Apps > Installed apps**.
* Right-click on **Microsoft Store** and select **Advanced options**.
