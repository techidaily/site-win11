 Most apps and programs on your computer require internet access to function. Therefore, when apps can’t connect to the internet on Windows, they are of little use. Fortunately, it’s possible to fix this annoying issue.

## 1\. Disable Windows Defender Firewall

 Windows Defender Firewall keeps track of all apps and programs that connect to the internet. As a precautionary measure, it may occasionally block an app's internet access and display the “Windows Defender Firewall has blocked some features of this app” security alert. This is one of the most common reasons why an app may fail to connect to the internet on Windows.

 You can temporarily disable the Windows Defender Firewall to see if it fixes the issue.

1. Press**Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type**control panel** in the box and select the first result that appears.
3. In the Control Panel window, use the drop-down menu in the top right corner to change the view type to**Large icons** .
4. Click on**Windows Defender Firewall** .
5. Select**Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off** from the left pane.
6. Under Private and Public network Settings, select the**Turn off Windows Defender Firewall (not recommended)** option.
7. Click**OK** to save the changes.

 Check to see if your apps can connect to the internet now. If this solves your problem, you may have to allow your apps through Windows Firewall. If you need help, check our guide on[how to allow apps through Windows Firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-allow-apps-windows-firewall/) and follow the steps outlined there.

## 3\. Run Windows Troubleshooters

 Windows 10 and 11 include a few troubleshooters that can automatically detect and resolve common system-level issues. Running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter should resolve any issues with your apps and restore their ability to connect to the internet.

To run Windows Store Apps troubleshooter:

1. Open the**Start menu** and click the**gear-shaped icon** to launch the Settings app.
2. In the**System** tab, click on**Troubleshoot** .
3. Select**Other troubleshooters** .
4. Click the**Run** button next to**Windows Store Apps** and follow the on-screen prompts to run the troubleshooter.

Here’s how to do it.

 After the reset is complete, your PC will restart. Following that, your issue will be resolved.

## 8\. Troubleshoot the Issue With a Clean Boot

 At times, third-party programs and services running on your PC can disrupt Windows processes and lead to such problems. To check for this possibility, you need to boot your PC in a clean boot start.

 In a clean boot state, Windows only runs with essential drivers and programs. This can help you determine if a third-party app or service is causing trouble.

 If you'd like to learn more about the topic, check out our guide on[how to perform a clean boot on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-perform-clean-boot-windows-10/) and follow the steps listed there. If you perform a clean boot and the issue goes away, it means that one of the disabled services is the culprit. Now you can slowly re-activate the services until the problem reappears, and voila: you know what's causing the issue.
