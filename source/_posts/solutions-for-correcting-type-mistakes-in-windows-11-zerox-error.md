## Solutions for Correcting Type Mistakes in Windows 11 Zerox Error

 The voice typing feature in Windows 11 usually enables users to input text (word process) by speaking into their PCs’ microphones. However, some users have reported a 0x80049dd3 voice typing error during 2022\. Those users see this error message when they try to utilize voice typing, “Something went wrong: 0x80049dd3.”

 As a result, users can’t input text with voice typing. Sure, you can always use your keyboard for word processing; but those who need to fix this issue no doubt prefer speech-to-text dictation. This is how you can fix the 0x80049dd Voice Typing error in Windows 11.

## 1\. Run the Recording Audio and Speech Troubleshooters

 Windows 11 includes two troubleshooters that could come in handy for fixing the 0x80049dd3 error. The Recording Audio troubleshooter can resolve sound recording issues. Or you can try running the Speech troubleshooter, which is a slightly more specific one for fixing microphone-related errors. You can open the recording troubleshooting tool in the following steps:

1. Bring up Windows 11’s Settings app by selecting it in the Start menu.
2. Scroll down the**System** tab and click**Troubleshoot** .
3. Next, click**Other trouble-shooters** to view that part of Settings.

3. Select**Control Panel** to view its window.

## 2\. Check for Windows 11 Updates

 Microsoft has reputedly acknowledged error 0x80049dd3, which means the big M may have released a patch update that addresses it. Windows is usually automatically updated, but there might still be some available updates your PC is missing. So, check for and install all available Windows 11 updates like this:

1. To access the Settings app, hold the**Windows** key and press**I** simultaneously.
2. Next, click**Windows Update** to view that tab’s options.
3. Press**Check for updates** to see what Windows 11 updates, if any, are available.

6. Then select the checkboxes for updates listed there, and click the**Download and install** options.

## 3\. Check the Settings for Your Microphone

 Windows 11’s Settings app includes microphone access options that need to be enabled for voice typing to work. Double-check that microphone access is enabled for all apps you want to utilize for voice typing. This is how you can enable mic access in Windows 11:

1. Open up Settings from the Start menu or with that app’s**Windows** +**I** keyboard shortcut.
2. Then select**Privacy & security** in Settings.
3. Next, click the**Microphone** navigation option.  
![The Microphone navigation option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/microphone-navigation-option.jpg)
4. Toggle on the**Microphone access** option if it is disabled.  
![The microphone access settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/microphone-access-settings.jpg)
5. Turn on the**Let apps access your microphone** setting.
6. Make sure the microphone access options for all apps you need to utilize the mic with are turned on.

 It’s also recommended to try setting up the mic again from Settings. To do that, select**Speech** on the**Time & language** tab in Settings. Click the**Get started** button for setting up Microphone speech recognition. Then go through the setup instructions.

## 4\. Update the Driver for Your Microphone

 You might need to fix error 0x80049dd3 because your PC’s microphone has an outdated or corrupted driver. An easy way to check if that’s the case is to run a scan with a third-party tool like Driver Booster.

 If Driver Booster, or alternative software, shows your microphone’s driver needs updating, you can select to update it from there. Our [guide to updating drivers with Driver Booster 8](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-drivers-driver-booster-8/) (now version 10) tells you how to update device drivers with that software.

7. Sign out of Windows 11 and log in to the newly created user account.
8. Try using voice typing in your new user account.

 If this solution works, you can transfer your user files to the new account.

You can copy data from your old account into the new one at these folders paths:

`C:\Users\<Old_Username>\nC:\Users\<New_Username>`
