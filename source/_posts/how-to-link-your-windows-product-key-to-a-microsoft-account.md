## How to Link Your Windows Product Key to a Microsoft Account

 If you have a genuine copy of Windows 10 or 11 (which you should have!) linking the product key to your Microsoft account is very important. Doing so can prevent headaches down the line when you need to use it again.

 In this article, we'll guide you through linking your Windows product key to your Microsoft account.

## What Are the Benefits of Linking a Microsoft Account to a Windows Product Key?

 Linking your Windows Product key to your Microsoft account may not bring immediate benefits to you, but in the long run, there are lots of advantages that you can't afford to overlook.

 One major benefit is that you can reactivate Windows quickly, thus eliminating the need for you to type your 25-character product key or contact Microsoft to verify the key. So, if you're planning to make significant hardware changes to your PC, make sure that you link the product key to your Microsoft account before making such modifications.

 Linking your key to your Microsoft account also helps you track your devices and licenses on the **Account** page in Windows Settings app. However, linking your Windows licenses to the Microsoft account will also mean that the software company will collect and share your data with some of its partners and advertisers.

 That said, you can control which types of data you want or don't want to share with the companies. In other words, a Microsoft account is not exactly a direct threat to your privacy if you know how to use it.
