## 1\. Check Your ISP's Data Plan

 Even if Windows shows the Limited access message when you connect to the Wi-Fi, there’s a chance you don’t have any system or connectivity issues.

 Depending on your ISP (or Internet Service Provider), you might have limited or unlimited data. If you have a data cap, and you exceed it, your Wi-Fi network might show limited access once you connect to it.

 You can check how much data you’ve used through Windows Settings. Press**Win + I** to bring up the Settings menu. Head to **Network & Internet > Advanced network settings > Data usage** . There, check your data usage and compare it with your data cap.

## 2\. Turn Off the Metered Connection Feature

 In case you’ve set up a metered connection to make sure you’re not going over your data cap, the Wi-Fi will show limited access if you’ve reached the limit. Now, if you no longer need Windows to keep an eye on your data usage you should disable the metered connection.

1. Right-click the**Start** button and go to**Settings** .
2. From the right pane, select**Network & internet > Wi-Fi** .
3. Select the network you’re connected to.
4. Turn off the**Metered connection** option.

## 7\. Check the Adapter Properties

 Another cause for Wi-Fi showing the Limited Access message might be inappropriate adapter properties. Here's how you can check them:

1. Open**Device Manager** .
2. Expand the**Network adapters** list.
3. Right-click the wireless adapter and select**Properties** .
4. Open the**Advanced** tab.

![Network adapter properties](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/set-adapter-auto-1.jpg)

 Depending on the adapter producer, you might not be able to set**Wireless Mode** to**Auto** . In this case, search for**802.11n Channel Width for 2.4GHz** and**802.11n Channel Width for 5.2Ghz** in the Property field and set their value to**Auto** .

## 8\. Stop Windows From Turning Off the Network Adapter

 Depending on your power management settings, Windows might turn off the network adapter if your computer has a low battery. While this may keep your computer working longer, it will cause the Wi-Fi network to show limited access.

 Right-click the network adapter and open the**Power management** tab. There, uncheck the**Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power** option.

## 9\. Reset Your Network

 When dealing with the Wi-Fi network showing limited access, it might be difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. If you’ve gone through the above instruction but didn’t find anything wrong with your system setting, you should reset the network.

 This way, Windows will revert network settings to their default values and reinstall all the network adapters.

Go through the following steps to reset the network:

1. Press**Win + I** to bring up Windows Settings.
2. Go to**Network & internet >** **Advanced network settings** .
3. Head to the**More settings** section and click**Network reset** .
4. Click the**Reset now** button.

 Keep in mind this will restart your computer, so make sure to save any work in progress and bookmark any browser tab that you might still need.
