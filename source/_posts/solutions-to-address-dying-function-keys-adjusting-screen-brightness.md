## Solutions to Address Dying Function Keys Adjusting Screen Brightness

 You may usually get eye strain or headaches when the brightness of your laptop or PC monitor is too low. Issues like this can be easily solved by adjusting the brightness with a simple press of the brightness function key.

 However, things get tricky if this key does not work anymore or has stopped functioning. In such cases, you may need to take a few steps in order to fix the brightness function key not working on Windows PC.

## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 Keyboard issues can sometimes be fixed with a simple restart. Restarting your computer will reset the keyboard settings and may make the brightness key work again.

 If you need, then open this guide and learn [different methods of restarting your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/) .

## 2\. Clean Your Keyboard to Remove Dirt and Grime

 Over time, dirt and debris can build up on and between the keys of your keyboard. This especially happens if you use your laptop in a dusty environment. Cleaning the keys can make them more responsive and help fix any problem with the brightness function key not working.

 If you don't know exactly how to clean the keyboard, you can see our guide on [how to clean your keyboard and sterilize viruses and bacteria](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-clean-keyboard/) .

5. Click**Apply** and then**OK** .

Now check if your keyboard is working properly.

## 8\. Scan for Malicious Programs

 If you downloaded any suspicious file or program, then the chances are that your keyboard is experiencing interference due to malware, spyware, or other malicious programs.

 To make sure it isn't the case, you can [check if a file is infected with a virus or not](https://www.makeuseof.com/check-suspicious-file-malware/) . In case you find one, you need to [scan your computer for viruses and then remove them](https://www.makeuseof.com/scan-for-viruses-without-buying-antivirus-software/) .

## 9\. Switch to a Different Keyboard

 Sometimes the problem is not others but the keyboard itself. It could have defective keys or some other hardware issue preventing it from functioning correctly; in that case, try using your device on another computer or laptop to be sure that the problem is not the operating system or software.

 If you find that your keyboard is the issue, then it’s time to replace it with a new one or get it repaired.
