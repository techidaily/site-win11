## How to Reactivate Quick Excel Performance in Windows

 Does Microsoft Excel feel slow or laggy on your Windows computer? This can hinder your ability to work efficiently and decrease overall productivity. Several factors can contribute to this, including unnecessary background processes, faulty add-ins, misconfigured settings, and more.

 Before you consider switching to Excel’s web version or another alternative, try the following tips to boost Excel’s performance on your Windows computer.

## 1\. Run Excel in Safe Mode

 One of the most common reasons why Excel may run slowly on your Windows computer is if one of the add-ins is disrupting app processes. To investigate this possibility, you can run Excel in safe mode.

 Press **Win + R** to [open the Run dialog box](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/). Type **excel /s** in the "Open" field and press **Enter**.

 Once Excel opens in safe mode, try using it for a few minutes and see if it runs smoothly. If it does, it indicates that one of your add-ins is causing the issue. To identify the problematic add-in, you will need to disable all add-ins and then re-enable them one at a time. To do so, use these steps:

1. Open Excel and click the **File** menu in the top left corner.
2. Select **Options** from the left pane.
3. In the Excel Options window, select the **Add-ins** tab.
4. In the right pane, select **COM Add-ins** in the **Manage** drop-down menu.
5. Click the **Go** button.
6. Uncheck all the boxes to disable add-ins and click **OK**.  
![Disable Excel Add-ins](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/disable-excel-add-ins.jpg)

 Restart Excel on your PC and enable your add-ins one at a time. Try using Excel after enabling each add-in and observe its performance. Once you identify the faulty add-in, consider removing it.

## 2\. Optimize Excel for Compatibility

 Another thing you can do to improve Excel’s performance on Windows is to optimize its interface for compatibility instead of the best appearance. This can lead to better overall performance and smoother operation.

1. Open Excel using the search menu.
2. Head to **File > Options**.
3. In the **General** tab, select **Optimize for compatibility** under the **User Interface Options** section.
4. Click **OK** to save the changes.  
![Optimize Excel for Compatiblity](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/optimize-excel-for-compatiblity.jpg)

 Restart Excel after this and check if it still runs slowly or lags on your Windows computer.

## 3\. Disable Hardware Graphics Acceleration

[Hardware graphics acceleration](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-hardware-acceleration/) is a useful feature in Microsoft Excel that allows the app to use your GPU and enhance performance during graphics-related tasks. However, if this feature fails to work as expected, Excel may operate slowly on Windows.

 You can try disabling the hardware graphics acceleration in Excel to see if that fixes the problem.

1. In Excel, head to **File > Options**.
2. Select the **Advanced** tab in the Excel Options window.
3. Under the **Display** section, tick the **Disable hardware graphics acceleration** checkbox.
4. Click **OK** and restart Excel.

## 4\. Enable Manual Calculation

 When you make changes to a cell, Excel recalculates all formulas and functions. This process can be resource-intensive and result in the app lagging when you input or edit data.

 To fix this, you can try enabling manual calculation mode in Excel. For that, switch to the **Formulas** tab, click the **Calculation Options** button, and select **Manual**. Following this, you can press **F9** any time you want Excel to recalculate.

## 5\. Reduce the Size of Your Excel File

 The larger your spreadsheet, the more calculations and operations Excel has to perform. This can have a negative impact on Excel's performance and lead to various problems. To avoid this, you can try reducing the size of your Excel workbook by decreasing the number of sheets, removing unnecessary formatting, and compressing any pictures within your workbook.

 Another thing you can do is save your Excel file in binary (.xslb) format. To do so, press **F12** on your keyboard to bring up the **Save As** dialog in Excel. Click the drop-down menu next to **Save as type** to select **Excel Binary Workbook (\*.xslb)** and click the **Save** button.

## Save As Dialog in Excel

## 6\. Update Microsoft Excel

 Are you using an outdated version of Excel? If so, you may be missing out on new features and performance enhancements. Try updating Excel on your PC and see if that improves its performance on your Windows computer.

1. Open Microsoft Excel and click the **File** menu in the top left corner.
2. Select **Account** from the left sidebar.
3. Click **Update Options > Update Now**.

 Wait for Microsoft Office to update Excel along with other Office apps and check if that fixes the problem.

## 7\. Run the Office Repair Tool

1. Press **Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type **Control Panel** in the box and press **Enter**.
3. Go to **Programs and Features**.
4. Scroll through the list to locate and select **Microsoft Office**.
5. Click the **Change** button at the top.
6. Select the **Quick Repair** option and then click **Repair**.

## 8\. Try Some Generic Windows Fixes

 If none of the above tips help, you can try some generic fixes to speed up Excel’s performance on Windows.
