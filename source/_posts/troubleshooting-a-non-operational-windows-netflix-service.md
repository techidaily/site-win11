## Troubleshooting a Non-Operational Windows Netflix Service

 Watching Netflix with the Windows app will give you the best audio and video quality for your favorite movies and TV shows. As long as you have an internet speed of 15MB or higher, the right Netflix subscription plan, and a compatible device, there’s nothing stopping you. That is, unless the Netflix app decides to stop working on your Windows computer.

 If you don’t want to compromise your streaming experience, here are some ways to fix the Netflix app when it stops working on Windows.

## 1\. Check Your Internet Connection

 Before blaming Netflix for ruining your movie marathon, take a quick look at your internet connection. Unless you already downloaded your favorite TV shows from Netflix, there’s no way to watch anything on Netflix without an internet connection.

 Even if you use one of the[best internet speed-checking websites](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-websites-test-internet-speed/) and everything seems fine, keep in mind that there are Netflix connection speed recommendations listed on the[Netflix help center](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306?ba=SwiftypeResultClick&q=Internet%20connection%20speed%20recommendations) . If you can’t meet the stated recommendations, Netflix might buffer or stop playing altogether.

## 2\. Restart the App

 Before trying more complicated solutions, restart the app. After closing it, press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open**Task Manager** . Then, right-click**Netflix** and select**End task** . This way, there’s no Netflix-related process running in the background that might hinder the app’s functionality.

## 3\. Check if Netflix Is Down

 Sometimes, you can blame Netflix if the app stopped working on your computer. Even big streaming platforms, such as Netflix, might be affected by a service outage.

 You can go to[DownDetector](https://downdetector.com/status/netflix/) and check if there have been reported problems with Netflix. Also, you can check Netflix's status in your region.

## 4\. Update Netflix

 Netflix's developers are constantly releasing new updates to fix any bug or glitch. Usually, the app should update when you launch it, so it keeps working without any issues. However, you can manually update it to make sure you’re using the latest available version.

 Launch Microsoft Store and select**Library** . Then, click the**Get updates** button to install any pending updates.

## 5\. Run the Windows Store Apps Troubleshooter

 Windows has one more tool that you can use to fix the Netflix app if it stops working. Follow these steps to run the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter:

1. Right-click the**Start** button and go to**Settings** .
2. Go to**System > Troubleshoot > Other trouble-shooters** .
3. From the**Other** list, click**Run** next to**Windows Store Apps** .

![Running Windows store troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/store-troubleshooter-1.jpg)

 Windows will now scan your apps installed from the Microsoft Store and automatically fix any detected problems.

## 6\. Repair the App

 If the Netflix app is still glitching, you can repair it through Windows Settings.

1. Press**Win + I** to open**Settings** .
2. Go to**Apps > Apps & features** .
3. Click the**three-dot** icon next to**Netflix** and select**Advanced options** .
4. Click the**Repair** button.

![Repair Netflix](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/repair-netflix-1.jpg)

 If repairing the app didn’t fix the problem, you can try resetting it. Go through the instructions above again, and select**Reset** .

## 7\. Update Your Display Adapters

 If Netflix isn’t the only media-playing app that is malfunctioning on your computer, there might be an issue with your display adapters. Here’s how you can update them.

1. Right-click the**Start** button and select**Device Manager** .
2. Extend the**DIsplay adaptors** drop-down menu.
3. Right-click the driver and select**Update** .

 If you’ve updated the drivers, but you’re still having issues watching Netflix or any other media content on your computer, it might be one of the[signs that it's time to upgrade your graphics card](https://www.makeuseof.com/signs-its-time-to-upgrade-your-graphics-card/) .

## 8\. Adjust Your System’s Graphics Settings

 By default, Windows decides which GPU should Netflix use. While this may be an efficient way to[improve your laptop battery's life](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-improve-battery-life/) , it may affect the app’s functionality. So, if your computer has a dedicated graphics card, you should allow Netflix to use it.

1. Press**Win + I** to bring up the Settings menu.
2. Go to**System > Display** .
3. Scroll down to**Related settings** and select**Graphics** .
4. From the apps list, select**Netflix** and click**Options** .
5. In the pop-up window, select which graphics card will Netflix use.

## 9\. Reset Microsoft Store

 In general, if you can’t open the Netflix app, it’s because of corrupted Microsoft Store files. If this happens, you shout reset Microsoft Store.

1. Press**Win + R** to launch a Run dialog.
2. Type**cmd** and press**Shift + Enter** to open Command Prompt with administrative rights.
3. Type**wsreset.exe** and press**Enter** to run the command.
4. Launch Microsoft Store and reinstall Netflix.

## 10\. Delete the DNS Cache

 Windows stores IP addresses in its cache data, and it uses DNS to accelerate network performance. However, a DNS misconfiguration might stop the Netflix app from working properly. In this case, you should delete the DNS cache.

 Launch Command Prompt with administrative rights and type in the**ipconfig/flushdns** command line. Then, press**Enter** .

Restart your computer and check if Netflix is now working.

## 11\. Delete the MSPR.HDS File

 When using Netflix or a similar app, Windows creates a**MSPR.HDS** file and Netflix uses it for DRM (or Digital Rights Management). Deleting it might get the Netflix app working again.

 Usually, the file is stored at "C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\PlayReady." If you can't find it there, you can use File Explorer's search feature or use one of the[best free search tools for Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-best-free-search-tools-windows-10/) to locate it. If you find multiple**MSPR.HDS** files, delete them and restart your computer. Then, check if the Netflix app is working.

 After you delete the file, Windows will automatically create a new one, so don't worry about breaking your PC.

## 12\. Reinstall the Netflix App

 If you didn’t find anything wrong with your system settings and Netflix seems to be working fine on your browser, you should reinstall the app. Use one of the many[ways to uninstall software from Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/) to get rid of it, then re-download the app and try again.

 When downloading the app again, make sure you're getting it from a trustworthy source. We recommend using the[Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/netflix/9WZDNCRFJ3TJ?hl=en-gb&gl=gb) .

## 13\. Watch Netflix on Your Browser

 If nothing worked, and you still can’t use the Netflix app to watch your favorite shows, there’s no other option than to watch Netflix on a browser.

 However, you should know that not every browser will offer you the same 4K image quality the app has. So, you should check out[which browser is the best to watch Netflix](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-browser-watching-netflix/) and pick the p\[perfect browser for your needs.

## Get Netflix Working Again on Windows

 Sometimes, it’s hard to pinpoint what is causing the Netflix app to stop working. It might be a network problem, an improper system setting, or the app itself. However, with a bit of patience, you’ll be able to sort it out, unless Netflix is down, in which case all you can do is wait.

 But if this happens, there are other streaming services you could try. Some are even free and don't require a sign-up.
