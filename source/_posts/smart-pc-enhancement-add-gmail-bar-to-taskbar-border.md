## Smart PC Enhancement: Add Gmail Bar to Taskbar Border

 If you are anything like the average Windows computer user, you probably use Gmail almost daily. However, whether it’s your essential work emails that need quick answers or it's your miscellaneous notifications, opening your Gmail by going to your browser against and again can be hectic.

 This is where pinning your Gmail emails to the taskbar can instantly ease things up for you. So, let’s jump right in and see how you can pin your Gmail emails to the taskbar.

## How to Pin Gmail to a Taskbar on a Windows PC

 If you use Chrome for web surfing on your PC, then follow the below methods to pin Gmail emails to your Windows taskbar:

1. Head to the Gmail website and log into your account.
2. Now click on the**More** button from the top-right corner.
3. Select**More tools > Create shortcut**
4. You will then get a prompt to give a name to your new account. Type in a name and click on**Create** .

 You will get a new Gmail shortcut on your desktop as soon as you follow the above steps. Now, right-click the newly created shortcut, and select**Pin to the taskbar** . That’s it—your[Windows taskbar will be customized](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-customize-taskbar/) and the Gmail shortcut will get pinned to your Windows taskbar.

## How to Pin Gmail to the Taskbar for Edge Users

 On the other hand, if you[use Edge like most loyal Windows users](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-edge-reasons-to-use/) do, the exact steps to pin your Gmail icon will be slightly different. Here’s how you can get started:

* Launch the Edge browser and head to the official Gmail website.
* Login with your Gmail account.
* Click on the drop-down menu (Settings and more) from the top-left corner of your Edge browser.
* Head to**More tools** , and you will get two distinct options related to pining:**Pin to taskbar** or**Pin to Start** .
* Select**Pin to taskbar** . Your new shortcut will be pinned to the taskbar from now on.

## Pining Gmail to the Taskbar on Your Windows PC
