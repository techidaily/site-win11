## Mastery Level: PowerShell Setup with Admin Privileges in Windows 11

 PowerShell is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language built on .NET technology. It's designed especially for system administrators and power users, so it has more features than the standard Command Prompt. If you want to use PowerShell to do anything more than basic tasks, you must run it as an administrator.

 In this guide, we'll show you ten simple ways to open an elevated PowerShell prompt on Windows 11.

## 1\. How to Open Windows PowerShell as an Administrator Using the Power User Menu

 The Power User Menu is a great way to quickly access important system tools and settings in Windows 11\. To open Windows PowerShell using the Power User Menu, do the following:

1. Right-click on**Start** to open the quick access menu. You can also access it by pressing**Win + X** on your keyboard.
2. From the menu list, select**Terminal (Admin)** .

3. If UAC appears on the screen, click**Yes** to grant permission.

## 2\. How to Open Windows PowerShell as an Administrator From the Windows Search Tool

 PowerShell will now open with administrative privileges. Here you can type any PowerShell command you want to execute. To exit PowerShell, type "Exit" and press**Enter** .

## 3\. How to Open Windows PowerShell as an Administrator Through the Run Command

 There is a powerful tool in Windows 11 called Run Command that lets you access files, launch programs, and adjust many system settings. You can also use it to launch Windows PowerShell as an administrator. Here's how:
