## Unlocking the Hidden Features of System Restore in Win11

 It is recommended always to update Windows to get the latest features, security patches, and bug fixes. However, Windows may sometimes apply a safeguard hold to prevent you from installing an available feature update.

 But what exactly is this feature, and how can you disable it? And more importantly, is it safe to disable the safeguard hold feature on Windows? Here's everything you need to know.

## What Is a Safeguard Hold?

 A safeguard hold is a Windows feature that prevents your device from receiving new feature updates. It is applied to the updating service when Microsoft thinks that an available update could have a negative impact on your device. It is also applied when there is an issue with the update itself, and no immediate solution is available.

 Microsoft uses safeguard holds to ensure that you have an error-free experience when you move to a new version of Windows. The hold is automatically lifted once a fix is found and verified.

 There is no specific timeframe for when a safeguard hold will be removed from the Windows Update client. It depends on the time it takes to investigate and resolve the issue with the update.

 Microsoft only applies safeguard holds to devices that download updates from the Windows Update service. If you manage updates through other channels, such as media installations or [Microsoft's Update Catalog](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/microsoft-windows-update-catalog/), you must be aware of any known issues with the updates that could affect your device.

 You can check the [Windows Health Dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/) to learn about any ongoing issues with updates.

## Can You Disable Windows Update's Safeguard Holds, and Is It Safe to Do So?

 Disabling the safeguard hold is not recommended, as it can lead to compatibility issues and BSOD errors. However, if you are confident that your device is compatible with the new feature update, you can disable the safeguard hold using the Registry Editor or the Local Group Policy Editor.

### 1\. Disable Safeguard Hold Using the Registry Editor

 The quickest way to turn off safeguard hold and receive updates is by editing the Windows registry. Here's how to do it.

 Editing the registry carries inherent risks, as a single incorrect edit can potentially render your computer unstable. Therefore, make sure to [back up the Windows registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) and [create a restore point on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) before proceeding with the steps.

1. Press **Win + R** hotkey to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type **regedit** in the search bar and press Enter.
3. Navigate to the following location in the Registry Editor:  
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate`
4. Right-click the **WindowsUpdate** key in the left sidebar, hover over **New**, and select **DWORD (32-bit) Value**.  
![DWORD (32-bit) Value in the Registry Editor](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/dword-32-bit-value.jpg)
5. Name the string value **DisableWUfBSafeguards**.
6. Double-click the DisableWUfBSafeguards string value, type **1** in the Value data field, and click **OK**.

3. In the Local Group Policy Editor, navigate to the following location:

6. Click **Apply** and then **OK**.

 But what exactly is this feature, and how can you disable it? And more importantly, is it safe to disable the safeguard hold feature on Windows? Here's everything you need to know.
