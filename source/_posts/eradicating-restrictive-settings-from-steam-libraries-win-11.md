## Eradicating Restrictive Settings From Steam Libraries Win 11

 While Steam is without any issues for many, some users face the “Steam library folder not writable” error when they try to install a game using the Steam client. The error also appears while installing an update for the app.

 If you face the same predicament, don’t fret. Let's explore multiple methods to resolve this annoying error code and help you successfully install your games on Steam again.

## 1\. Change the Steam Folder Attributes

 Steam needs to have both read and write permissions to make changes to any sub-folder inside the Steam folder. If the steamapps folder is set to "read-only," the error can pop up and prevent you from installing the game. Repeat the following steps to change the Steam folder attributes:

1. Press **Win + E** to [open a new File Explorer window](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/).
2. Type the following path in the address bar at the top and press the **Enter** key to navigate to it: **C:\\Program Files (x86)**
3. Double-click on the **Steam** folder. Now, right-click on the **steamapps** folder and select the **Properties** option from the context menu.
4. Navigate to the **Attributes** section and uncheck the **Read-only** option.

## 3\. Grant Full Ownership of the Steam Folder

1. Press **Win + E** to open the File Explorer.
2. Type " C:\\Program Files (x86)" in the address bar at the top and press **Enter** to navigate to it:

5. The User Account Control window will pop up. Click on the **Yes** button.
6. After the repair completes, click on the **Close** button.

2. Click on the **Steam** button and then click on the **Settings** option.
3. Scroll down and click on the **Storage** option.

5. Now, click on the **plus** icon. Select the folder location and click on the **Add** button.
6. Close and relaunch Steam.

## 6\. Flush the Steam Download Cache

 An outdated or corrupt download cache can cause interference while installing games or updating the Steam client. So, you must empty the Steam download cache using the settings. Repeat the following steps to do so:

1. Launch the Steam client on your PC.
2. Click on the **Steam** button and then click on the **Settings** option to open the app settings.
3. Navigate down and click on the **Downloads** option.
4. Find the **Clear Download Cache** option in the right pane. Click on the **Clear Cache** button.  
![Flush the Download Cache-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/flush-the-download-cache-1.jpg)
5. Steam will reconfirm your decision to clear the cache. Click on the **Confirm** button.
6. The app will restart after purging the download cache. You will have to sign in again to your Steam account.

## 7\. Run a Check Disk Scan

 Hard Disk errors can be a reason due to which Steam is unable to add or modify files. You can [use the Check Disk utility in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/sir-mini-how-to-run-chkdsk-in-windows-10/) to check your hard disk for errors and fix them. The Check Disk utility will scan the hard disk for errors and repair them, if possible.

## 8\. Reinstall the Game on Another Drive

 If you are unable to install the game on the C drive, you must add another drive in the Steam Storage settings. Then, attempt the game installation in the newly added drive. Here’s how to do it:

1. Open the Steam app and click on the **Steam** button.
2. Click on the **Settings** option.
3. Scroll down and click on the **Storage** option.
4. Click on the **plus** icon. Expand the drop-down list and select a drive.  
![Reinstall the Game on Another Drive-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/reinstall-the-game-on-another-drive-1.jpg)
5. Now, click on the **Add** button.

## 9\. Format the Disk and Try Again

 Many users want to install games on a newly added disk drive but face the “Steam library folder not writable” error in the process. It is mainly because the newly added disk drive bears the same letter as the old drive with a Steam Library folder.

 As such, you must assign a new driver letter and reformat the disk. Here’s how to do it:

1. Open the **Start** menu and type **create and format disk partitions**. Click on the **Open** option in the right pane.
2. Right-click on the new drive whose letter you want to change. Select the **Change Drive Letter and Paths** option.
3. Click on the **Change** button.  
![Format the Disk And Try Again-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/format-the-disk-and-try-again-1.jpg)
4. Expand the drop-down list and select a new drive letter. Click on the **OK** button.
5. Now, right-click on the disk drive and select the **Format** option.
6. Keep the **File System** as **NTFS** and click on the **OK** button.  
![Format the Disk And Try Again 2-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/format-the-disk-and-try-again-2-1.jpg)
7. Lastly, click on the **OK** button once again.
8. **Close** the Disk Management utility.
