## Eradicating Restrictive Settings From Steam Libraries Win 11

 While Steam is without any issues for many, some users face the “Steam library folder not writable” error when they try to install a game using the Steam client. The error also appears while installing an update for the app.

 If you face the same predicament, don’t fret. Let's explore multiple methods to resolve this annoying error code and help you successfully install your games on Steam again.

## 7\. Run a Check Disk Scan

 Hard Disk errors can be a reason due to which Steam is unable to add or modify files. You can [use the Check Disk utility in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/sir-mini-how-to-run-chkdsk-in-windows-10/) to check your hard disk for errors and fix them. The Check Disk utility will scan the hard disk for errors and repair them, if possible.

## 9\. Format the Disk and Try Again

 Many users want to install games on a newly added disk drive but face the “Steam library folder not writable” error in the process. It is mainly because the newly added disk drive bears the same letter as the old drive with a Steam Library folder.

1. Open the **Start** menu and type **create and format disk partitions**. Click on the **Open** option in the right pane.
2. Right-click on the new drive whose letter you want to change. Select the **Change Drive Letter and Paths** option.
