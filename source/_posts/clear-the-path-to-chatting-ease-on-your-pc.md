## Clear the Path to Chatting Ease on Your PC

 Facebook Messenger (officially known as just "Messenger") is an excellent app for instant messaging, sharing images, videos, audio clips, and group chats. Initially, the app was only available for Android and iOS, but now it can be used on Windows as well by downloading it from the Microsoft Store. However, sometimes you may run into issues with the app working on Windows PC.

 In this case, you can try the solution listed below to fix the Facebook Messenger app.

## Why Is Facebook Messenger Not Working on My Windows PC?

 Fortunately, it's very easy to troubleshoot the problem. Below are all the effective fixes you can try if Messenger is not working on your computer.

To use the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter, follow the below steps:

## 4\. Check the System Date and Time

 This might sound odd, but Facebook Messenger might not work if the system is set to an incorrect date and time. This is because Messenger checks if its own time and date are in sync with Window's own. If there's any difference, it'll refuse to work.

 You can[change the system time and date](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-change-date-time/) by following the below steps:

1. Open the Settings menu and choose**Time & language** from the left pane.
2. Choose**Date & Time** .

![Repairing Messenger in the Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Repair-Messenger-1.jpg)

 Next, launch the Messenger app and check whether it is working. If not, you will have to reset the application.

 Resetting the app will clear the stored data and set them back to default. Below are steps on how to reset the Facebook Messenger App.

1. Open Settings > Apps > Installed apps.
2. Click on the three dots next to Messenger and choose Advanced options.
3. Click the**Reset** button.

## 6\. Clear the Microsoft Store Cache

 Clearing the Windows Store cache is another effective solution you can try if Facebook Messenger is not working on Windows PC. In fact, removing the Store cache can eliminate many other Windows issues as well. It's very simple to clear the Store cache and will take less than a minute.

[Open the Run dialog box](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) , type**wsreset.exe** and press Enter. A black Command Prompt window will pop up, indicating that the cache is being cleared. After a few seconds, the window will close, and Microsoft Store will open automatically.

## 7\. Temporarily Disable the Security App

 The security app ensures your system is free from malware attacks and viruses. It automatically blocks applications that it finds suspicious and harmful to your device. However, its security mechanism can sometimes prevent trusted applications like Facebook Messenger from running properly on your computer.

 As such, temporarily disable the security app of your computer and then check whether the Facebook Messenger is working. To disable the security app, right-click its icon in the system tray area and choose disable from the context menu. You can also read the user guide of your security program to know much about the disabling process.
