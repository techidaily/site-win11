## 1\. Scrivener

![Scrivener](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scrivener.jpg)

 Scrivener is a popular [word-processing app](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/microsoft-word-alternatives/) used by writers of all shades. Whether you're a novelist, a struggling screenwriter starving for ideas and focus, or perhaps a ruminating technology writer like us at MUO—Scrivener has something for everyone.

 For instance, its Corkboard feature is one of a kind planning tool. See, back in the old days, writers used to have index cards for writing and editing individual sections of a piece or story, and then shuffle them up on the typical bulletin board. Now, with Scrivener, you can do the same on your computer.

 The "Collection" feature is another handy plus for this app. It helps you create a list of related documents from any part of your project or story. The third feature, and it combines well with the Collection, is Snapshots. Take a "snapshot" of any version of a piece of writing, and you can return to its earlier version whenever you want.

 These and a litany of other features make Scrivener a writer's gem, despite the initial learning curve that some people report facing.

 Language Tool is a free, open-source [grammar and spelling checker](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-download-free-spelling-checkers/) that helps you write or paraphrase your writing. Besides the simple grammar and spelling checker, the tool offers a host of other features, such as:

* Punctuation checker.
* Polish your style by detecting and getting rid of overused phrases, weak word choices, etc.
* AI-powered paraphrasing to rephrase your sentences.
* Add-ons for all the popular browsers, as well as Office plugins.

 Another popular alternative to Language Tool is Grammarly, which only offers English support. Also, if you want to keep your privacy in check, Grammarly is not the right choice as anything it touches gets uploaded to its servers.

 Language Tool, on the hand, also gives you the feature of self-hosting.

## 3\. Focus-To-Do

![focus to do](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/focus-to-do.jpg)

 As its name suggests, Focus-To-Do doesn't have to do anything with writing itself. Instead, a combination of task management and [Pomodoro app on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/pomodoro-timer-app-windows/), Focus-To-Do helps you focus and get your writing down without any distractions.

 Besides the features that help you get your writing out the way, what makes it stand out is its no-frills approach to design and task management.

 Simply add a task to the "Add a task" section on the main page and hit **Enter**. Click on the 'play' sign, and the pomodoro will be launched. By default, it will be a 45-minute task. You can, of course, change the timings. Also, you can pause your tasks in between, stop them completely, and even add white noise to remove distractions.

 If you're particularly prone to distraction, Focus-To-Do is an excellent tool to keep in your writer's bag.

 Making huge waves in the AI scene, [ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chat-gpt-generative-ai-explained/) can help you with your writing. ChatGPT is an AI tool that can have a human-like dialogue with you, among other things. And when it comes to [learning how to use ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-by-openai/), the use cases are as limited as only the user's imagination. As a writer, for you, that means the applications are infinite—at least theoretically.

 While [ChatGPT will never replace the human aspects of writing](https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-replace-me/), there are ways you can use it to improve your writing process. Here are a few of them**:**

* **Creative writing:** While there's no machine that matches humans in creativity—for now, at least—you can use ChatGPT to brainstorm new ideas, learn new writing techniques and paradigms, or even help you develop your plots.
* **Learning new information:** It's been asserted that internet search is history now, soon to be entirely replaced by ChatGPT. While what happens in the future remains to be seen, it's undoubtedly the case that ChatGPT is handy for learning new information, facts, data, or figures. This is especially true if the information in question is static instead of dynamic. That means old statistics, historical instances, philosophical concepts, and a dearth of analysis on these topics—all are available at your fingertips. Though note that ChatGPT doesn't always give your correct data or information. So make sure you double-check the data before you make use of it.
* **Editing:** Have you ever thought how great it would've been if you could afford to get a personal editor? With ChatGPT, it's now a reality for a lot of writers on a budget. Again, while it can't match the nuance of a good human editor, it does a good enough job of tidying up your writing. You can use it to proofread, copyedit, keep a check on your style and tonality, etc.—basically, keep an eye out for all things a real, flesh-and-blood editor would.

 The above applications, with a plethora of others, make ChatGPT a must-have tool to help you refine your writing.

 As handy as ChatGPT is for a whole gamut of things, you need to remember that it's still fallible. In fact, users all around the globe have caught it handing out false facts or figures with utmost authority. So, it's important that you don't treat it as a panacea for all your queries. However, treat it as just another tool that will aid you in your personal or professional life, and you will have a good time.

## 5\. Hemingway Editor

 Hemingway Editor is a popular web-based editor that highlights the use of passive voice, adverbs, and other incorrect use of phrases in your writing to make it read more clearly and boldly.

 For example, if you see Hemingway has highlighted a sentence as yellow, it's probably because it's too complex or lengthy; shortening it or simplifying it is recommended there.

 Similarly, you should use shorter or simpler words in places of purple highlights. On the other hand, phrases in green highlight the use of passive voice. Moreover, the app also gives you a quick overview of the reading time, the no. of sentences, words, and paragraphs in any specific writing.

 Besides the online app, Hemingway also has a desktop version—available for both Mac and Windows.
