## Navigating the Shutdown of Windows Privacy Tools

 Data privacy has been an important topic of conversation in recent years, and users have been demanding stricter data privacy laws from tech companies such as Meta, Google, and even Microsoft. While many legal gray areas still exist that tech companies utilize to safeguard themselves from scrutiny, you must safeguard yourself by configuring privacy protection settings.

 There are several ways to disable tracking or telemetry features in Windows 11; read on as we help you take control of your Windows 11 activity data.

## How Does Windows 11 Track Your Data?

 Windows 11, much like its predecessor Windows 10, continuously collects a significant amount of user data. While some of this happens in the background, most data collection is based on your user activity. Microsoft claims to collect user data to better understand how their customers use their products and improve the overall user experience.

 Some methods Microsoft uses to collect data from an average Windows 11 user are location services, cookies, diagnostic feedback, and browser activity in Microsoft Edge. Any third-party apps installed on your Windows 11 PC may also collect your activity and location data.

## Should You Be Worried About Your Data Privacy on Windows 11?

 As a Windows 11 user, you should be aware of apps that collect your data and understand what your preset Windows 11 activity tracking preferences mean. Microsoft tracks its users to improve the experience of their users, but more importantly, to make advertisements more relevant and personalized.

 Your activity data directly contributes to how relevant the advertisements you receive are. To a certain extent, this means that Windows 11 keeps track of the websites you visit, how you interact with ads, your current location, etc.

 If you, like most people, are concerned about your data privacy and do not want Microsoft taking advantage of your user activity, you should consider turning off tracking features on Windows 11\. Even if you cannot completely disable the tracking features, you should opt out of voluntary data collection preferences.

## How to Disable Advertising Data Tracking on Windows 11

 If you’re concerned about your data or activity patterns being used by third parties for advertisement, you should consider turning off the relevant settings. To turn off advertising data tracking on Windows 11:

1. Open the**Start** menu and launch the**Settings** app.

2. From the side pane, select**Privacy & security** , and then under**Windows permissions,** select the**General** tab.
3. Turn off all of the general preferences by using the toggle option.

 Once you complete the above steps, you will successfully opt out of personalized ads on Windows 11.

## How to Disable Activity Tracking on Windows 11

 Activity history is a shady Windows 11 feature that has plenty of privacy concerns. According to [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/-windows-activity-history-and-your-privacy-2b279964-44ec-8c2f-e0c2-6779b07d2cbd) , the feature allows users to keep track of how they use their Windows 11 devices. This includes recording what apps, services, websites, and files users have used or accessed recently. If your PC is signed in with a Microsoft account, your data is sent to Microsoft; otherwise, your activity history is only stored locally on your device.

 Your activity history is used to personalize your Windows experience and provide relevant suggestions. The Windows 11**Timeline** and Microsoft Edge utilize your activity history.

 To disable**Activity history** tracking on Windows 11:

1. Launch the**Settings** app via the**Start** menu.
2. Navigate to**Settings > Privacy & security** .
3. Under**Windows permissions** , select**Activity history** .

## How to Stop Microsoft Edge Data Collection on Windows 11

1. Launch**Microsoft Edge** via the Taskbar or the**Start** menu.
2. Click on the 3-dots menu icon in the far right and select**Settings** from the dropdown menu.  
![edge tracking prevention](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/edge-tracking-prevention.jpg)

## Controlling Your Location Tracking on Windows 11
