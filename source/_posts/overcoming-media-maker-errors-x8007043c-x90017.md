 Third-party antivirus can be overzealous and block genuine system modifications as malicious. You can disable the security app temporarily to determine if your third-party antivirus is triggering the error.

 Once disabled, relaunch the Media Creation Tool and check if the error persists. If not, check and reconfigure your antivirus settings or switch to one of the[best antivirus solutions on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-antivirus-apps/) .
