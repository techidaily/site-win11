## How to Activate Superior Control Over Windows 11 Task Management

 Task Manager is an important Windows tool that allows you to monitor the applications and processes running on your computer. It also provides access to vital system information, such as RAM usage and CPU temperature.

 However, in some cases, you may need elevated privileges to access some of the more advanced features and capabilities of Task Manager. In this article, you will find a detailed tutorial on how to run Task Manager as an administrator in Windows 11.
