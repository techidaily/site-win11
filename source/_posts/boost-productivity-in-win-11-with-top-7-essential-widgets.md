 Before installing widgets, it’s important to know how to access them and where to find widgets. With the help of keyboard shortcuts, accessing widgets in Windows 11 is easy.

 To open the widgets board, use the shortcut **Windows + W**. From here, you can view all installed widgets and add new ones. To add a new widget, hit the **plus** icon (**+**) at the top of the widgets board. Here, you can view all widgets created by Microsoft and access the Microsoft Store to explore further widgets. You can also [pin widgets to your desktop](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-add-widgets-desktop/) using a third-party app.

 To access all of Microsoft’s widgets, you’ll need to be signed in to your Microsoft account. Click the profile icon at the top right of the widgets board. At the top of the widget settings, hit the sign-in button to log in to your Microsoft account. Let’s explore the best widgets to boost your productivity.
