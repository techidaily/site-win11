## Installation Triumph: Fixed MSPM in Windows 10

 Microsoft PC Manager is a maintenance app that lets you optimize your system performance. It offers superfast malware removal, a one-click speed boost, and a full computer security check. At the time of writing, the app is in open beta. Therefore, it's very common to face issues with it.

 One of the more common issues is that the app fails to install on a Windows computer. As such, if Microsoft PC Manager fails to install on your computer, here are some fixes you can try.

## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 This is a common troubleshooting method, but it's essential for a reason. The reason that Microsoft PC Manager won't install on your system could be due to a temporary bug. Before you dive into the more advanced troubleshooting fixes, consider restarting y[our computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/) (see[how to restart your Windows PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/) ) to put it back on a clean slate.

 If you still can't install the application after a system restart, try the next solution on the list.

## 2\. Temporarily Disable Your Antivirus

 Most antivirus programs come with a security feature that stops installing malicious applications onto the computer. Unfortunately, they can sometimes block trusted applications like the Microsoft PC Manager. If this is the case with you as well, consider disabling the antivirus program temporarily as a solution.

 If you're using the Windows Security app as the default security program on your computer, here's how to disable it:

1. Open the Settings menu by pressing the**Win + I** hotkeys.
2. Select**Privacy & security** from the left panel.
3. In the Security section, select the**Windows Security** option.
4. Click the**Open Windows Security** button.
5. In the Windows Security app, click the**Virus & threat protection** option in the left panel.
6. Click**Manage settings** under Virus & threat protection settings.
7. Disable the toggle next**Real-time protection.**

 If you're using a third-party antivirus program, you can disable it by right-clicking on its icon in the system tray and choosing the "Disable" option from the context menu. You can also go through the antivirus support pages to learn more about how to disable it.

 After disabling the security program, give a quick restart to your computer and check if the problem continues.

## 3\. Use the Program Troubleshooter

 Windows 10 and 11 offer different troubleshooting options that you can use to detect and fix common issues. They don't always eliminate the problem, but they're worth a try when you are unable to install Microsoft PC Manager on your computer.

 In Windows 10, you can access the program troubleshooter by following the below steps:

1. Open Settings, and then select**Update & Security** .
2. Choose the**Troubleshoot** option. Then, select**Additional troubleshooters.**
3. In the Additional troubleshooters window, highlight the**Program Compatibility Troubleshooter** option and click the**Run the troubleshooter** button.

 The troubleshooter window will appear and scan your computer for issues.

 If you've Windows 11, open the Settings menu, and navigate to**System** \>**Troubleshoot** \>**Other troubleshooters** . Click the**Run** button next to Program Compatibility Troubleshooter.

 If running the built-in troubleshooter wasn't helpful, download and run the Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter from[Windows Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed-cca7d1b6-65a9-3d98-426b-e9f927e1eb4d) .

## 4 . Clear the Temp Folder

![Delete content of the Temp folder](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Temp-folder.jpg)

 Programs and apps installed on your store temporary files in the Temp folder. But for various reasons, the Temp folder can get corrupted and cause the issue at hand.

 The solution, in this case, is to clear the Temp folder. Don't worry; deleting the Temp folder is not going to have any adverse effect on your computer's data.

To delete the Temp folder, follow the below instructions:

1. Open the Run dialog box by pressing the**Win + R** hotkeys.
2. In the Run dialog box, type**Temp** and click**OK.** It'll open the Temp folder.
3. Select everything inside the Temp folder by pressing the**Ctrl + A** hotkeys.
4. Press the**Shift + Delete** hotkeys to clear the Temp folder's content permanently.

## 5 . Download Any Available Windows Updates

 Windows regularly releases updates to add new features and fix bugs and glitches. And from what it looks like, Microsoft PC Manager can fail to install on your computer due to a temporary glitch.

 To download any available Windows update, follow the below instructions:

1. Open the Settings menu and select**Windows Update** from the left panel.
2. Click the**Check for updates** option.  
![The Check for updates button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-check-for-updates-option.jpg)

 Windows will now look for and download any available updates. Once the update is installed, restart your computer and check for the issue.

## 6\. Fix Any Corrupted Files on Your Computer

 Another reason behind this issue is corruption within the system files. Fortunately, you can detect and fix these files by running an SFC scan. However, before we run the SFC scan, it is best to do a preliminary scan to ensure that the SFC tool is working properly.

 The Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool (DISM) is an integrated Windows utility that offers a wide range of functionalities. In this case, the DISM Restorehealth command makes sure that our next fix will work properly. Work through the below steps:

1. Open the Start menu, type**Command** **Prompt** in the search bar, and select the**Run** **as administrator** option. It'll open Command Prompt with admin rights.
2. In the elevated Command Prompt window, type**DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth** and press**Enter** .
3. Wait until the command is executed. Depending on your computer's health, the process can take up to 15 minutes. Sometimes the process will stick, but wait for it to complete.
4. After the process is complete, type**sfc /scannow** and press**Enter** .

## 7\. Reset Your Computer

![Reset PC button in Settings menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Reset-PC-.jpg)

 If you're still unable to install the Microsoft PC Manager, you can use the Windows Reset function. This will reinstall Windows, but it will keep all your personal files intact. Here's how to do it:

1. Navigate to Settings > System > Recovery.
2. Select the**Reset PC** button.

Next, follow the on-screen to complete the reset process.
