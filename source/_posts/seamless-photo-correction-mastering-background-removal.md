 The Remove background feature in MS Paint was part of the [Windows 11 Moment 4 update](https://www.makeuseof.com/new-windows-11-features-moment-4-update/). To get started, make sure you have the latest Windows 11 updates installed. To do this, go to **Settings > Windows Update** and choose **Check for updates**. You should also update [Microsoft Paint](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/paint/9PCFS5B6T72H) and [Paint 3D](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/paint-3d/9NBLGGH5FV99) from the Microsoft Store to receive new features.

 After the update is installed, launch any of the apps, and you'll see the **Remove background** or the **Magic select** option in the respective apps' toolbar. Using them is straightforward, as you can see below.

## How to Remove the Background of an Image Using Microsoft Paint

 The [background removal tool](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/3-easy-ways-to-remove-backgrounds-from-images-without-specialized-software/) in the standard Paint app is powered by AI. You can import any images onto your Paint canvas and click the Remove background feature to clean up the background with a single click.

 To remove an image background using the Paint app:

1. Launch **Paint** and import the image you want to edit.

2. In the **Command bar**, click the **Remove background** option. Microsoft Paint uses AI to process and detect the image elements and remove the background.

3. You can also use the selection tool to specify only part of the image to remove and then click the **Remove background** option.
4. To save the image, go to **File > Save as**, then choose the **PNG** or **JPEG** format. Enter a name for the file and click **Save**. The Paint app will save the file with a transparent background.

 As with most AI tools, the remove background feature is not perfect, but more often than not, it does a decent enough job.

## How to Remove the Background of an Image Using Paint 3D

 You can use the **Magic select** feature in Paint 3D to remove the background of an image. While the process is not as straightforward as the Paint app, it offers greater control and multiple creative options.

 To remove the background of an image using Paint 3D:

1. Launch the **Paint 3D** app and import the image you want to edit.

3. Adjust the focus area to fit around the area of the image you want to retain. Even if you want to keep a large part of the image, a slight adjustment is necessary for the app to determine the background.

5. In the right pane, toggle the **Transparent canvas** option.
6. Now drag the cutout back to the canvas and adjust it to fit the image.
7. To save the image, press **Ctrl + S**, click **Image,** and then **Save**. Give a name to the file and select **Save**.

 The AI-powered Paint and Paint 3D app in Windows 11 may not produce perfect results. Especially if the image has a busy background. However, both do a nice job and produce consistent backgrounds. They also save you from the hassle of owning and using a more sophisticated image editing tool for quick edits.
