## Refine Your Tapes: Best No-Cost Windows Software

 Creating a podcast has never been easier. All you have to do is record what you have to say and then find a way to share it with the world.

 But if you want your podcast to stand out, then making sure that it’s well-edited can be the difference between an episode two and never recording again.

 Luckily, there are a wide variety of different programs out there that can make editing podcasts easier than ever. Here are five of the best for you to look into.

## 1\. WavePad by NCH Software

 First up on this list, we have WavePad by NCH Software. WavePad is a great audio editing program and an excellent first addition to this list.

 If you’ve never done much audio mixing or podcast editing before, then WavePad is a great tool to dip your toe in. You can record directly into WavePad or import your existing recordings just fine, and there are a ton of different tools to help you on your way.

 All of the basic functionality that you might expect from a free podcast editing program is here, such as tools to cut, copy, paste, pitch shift, and more.

 On top of this, WavePad includes a lot of other useful tools and effects for you to make the most of. This includes fades, audio normalization, amplifications, and noise removal effects. There are also a series of batch tools that you can use to join or edit many files, among others.

 WavePad is a great place to get started for anyone looking to edit their podcasts for free, regardless of experience. If you’re particularly new to podcast editing there are several video tutorials available from within WavePad itself, and if you find yourself getting the hang of things you may even soon want to look into [how to become a podcast editor](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-become-a-podcast-editor/).

 Spreaker Studio is a podcast editing app that aims to make podcasting more accessible than ever before. There’s a lot to like here, with a wide range of recording and editing tools being put right at your fingertips.

 If you’ve never worked with audio editing tools before, then Spreaker Studio may be a good starting place as well. The interface is intuitive and easy to understand, and you can easily adjust the volume of individual tracks and cross-fading from within the interface.

 Cyberlink Audio 365 is an audio and podcast editing tool that aims to help you get more out of your recordings. The interface here is more reminiscent of a traditional audio mixing program, and there are a ton of features you can find here.

 Audio adjustments such as trimming, boosts, fades, leveling, pitch shifting, and much more are all available right from the left of the screen. At the top, you’ll find options to edit, mix, and finally produce your podcast.

 Cyberlink Audio 365 also comes with a variety of premium features such as sibilant removal, AI de-reverb, EQ matching, AI wind removal, smart background noise removal, punch and roll, and more.

 These features are some of the more impressive that Cyberlink Audio 365 has to offer, though it’s worth noting that you’ll only get free access to them for the first 30 days of your usage of the program. After that, you’ll be stuck with only the basic features until you upgrade your plan.
