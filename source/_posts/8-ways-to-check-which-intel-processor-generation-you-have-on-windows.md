 In the PowerShell window, type the following command, and hit **Enter**. You will get your processor name and Intel processor generation.

`Get-CimInstance Win32_Processor | Select Name`

 To find the total number of cores and threads in your processor, type the following command in the PowerShell window and hit **Enter**. You'll see the current core count for your CPU.

`(Get-CimInstance Win32_Processor).NumberOfCores`

 Similarly, type the following commands and hit Enter to get the total thread count.

`(Get-CimInstance Win32_Processor).NumberOfLogicalProcessors`

 These are some of the ways to check your Intel processor generation. Now you can use these tips before buying a new CPU or upgrading an old one to check Intel processor generation.

## Get to Know Your Intel Processor's Generation

 Hopefully, these methods helped you verify your Intel processor generation. Now you know what version your computer runs. If it's outdated, upgrading it can improve performance and stability. Just ensure your motherboard supports the processor.
