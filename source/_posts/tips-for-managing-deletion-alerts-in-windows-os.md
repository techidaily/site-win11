## Tips for Managing Deletion Alerts in Windows OS

 When you delete a file or folder on Windows, it is automatically moved to the Recycle Bin without any confirmation. If you don't want that, you can configure Windows to display a confirmation dialog when deleting files.

 You can enable or disable the delete confirmation dialog via Recycle Bin Properties, Registry Editor, or Group Policy Editor. Let's go over each of these methods one by one.
