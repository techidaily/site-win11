## Tips for Managing Deletion Alerts in Windows OS

 When you delete a file or folder on Windows, it is automatically moved to the Recycle Bin without any confirmation. If you don't want that, you can configure Windows to display a confirmation dialog when deleting files.

 You can enable or disable the delete confirmation dialog via Recycle Bin Properties, Registry Editor, or Group Policy Editor. Let's go over each of these methods one by one.

## 2\. Enable or Disable Delete Confirmation Dialog Using Group Policy Editor

If you're using Windows Home, you'll need to enable the Group Policy Editor first.

1. Press**Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type**registry editor** in the box and select the first result that appears.
3. Select**Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
4. Use the left pane to navigate to **HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER > Software > Microsoft > Windows > CurrentVersion > Policies > Explorer** .
5. Right-click on the Explorer key and select**New > DWORD (32-bit) Value** . Name it**ConfirmFileDelete** .
6. Double-click the newly created DWORD.
7. In the**Value data** field, enter**1** to enable the delete confirmation dialog.
8. Click**OK** and restart your PC to apply the changes.
