 After you complete the troubleshooting process, check to see if it solves the error.

## 4\. Temporarily Disable Security Software

 Sometimes third-party security software can interfere with the Windows Update process, which may result in error 0x80242016\. To rule this out, you can temporarily disable the security software and then try to install the update again.

 Usually, your antivirus will come with an option to temporarily disable its shields. If you're not sure how to do this, check out the documentation for your antivirus for instructions. If you're using Windows' built-in antivirus, check out[how to turn off the Windows Defender firewall on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-disable-microsoft-defender-firewall/) for in-depth steps.

 Once you have done this, restart your computer and try installing the update again.

## 5\. Run the SFC and DISM command

 If the above solutions didn't solve the issue, it may be worth running Windows's in-built System File Checker which scans your system for any missing or corrupted files and replaces them where needed.

 To run both, check out our guide on[the difference between CHKDSK, DISM, and SFC](https://www.makeuseof.com/difference-between-chkdsk-sfc-and-dism-in-windows-10/) for instructions on how to use these tools.

## 6\. Clear the Software Distribution Folder

 In order to install updates and avoid issues with error messages, the Software Distribution Folder needs to be cleared. This folder stores temporary files that are utilized while Windows is performing its updates; however, if this folder becomes corrupted, it can prevent you from successfully installing them.

 Therefore, cleaning out this important folder will help resolve any installation problems and allow your system to operate smoothly again. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the Run command dialog box (see[how to open the Run command box](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) for instructions on how to do this).
2. Type**cmd** and hit**Enter** to launch the Command Prompt.
3. In the command line, type the following command and press Enter after each one:  
`net stop wuauserv  
net stop bits  
net stop cryptSvc  
net stop msiserver`

 Running the above command will stop the services like BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer, and Windows Update.

1. Now open the File Explorer and navigate to the path:
2. C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution
3. Inside the SoftwareDistribution folder, select all the files (**Ctrl + A**) and hit Delete.
4. Next, open the Command Prompt window again and run the following command:  
`net start wuauserv  
net start bits  
net start cryptSvc  
net start msiserver`

 Once you complete the process, restart your computer and check Windows Update to make sure it solves the error code.
