## Navigate to Windows 11 Safe Mode in 6 Steps

### Key Takeaways

* Boot into safe mode using System Configuration for easy setup and boot customization.
* Access safe mode via the Settings app for a straightforward method to reboot in safe mode.
* To boot into safe mode from the lock screen, restart your PC and navigate through the Windows Recovery Environment.

 In safe mode, Windows starts with a basic set of drivers and files essential to run the system. Everything else, including start-up apps, networking, and Command Prompt, is disabled in safe mode. This helps you determine if an external hardware driver or program conflict is causing your system to malfunction.

 There are different types of safe modes and many ways to access them. If you need to diagnose your PC, here is how to boot into safe mode in Windows 11 on a working or non-booting computer.

## The Different Types of Safe Mode and When to Use Them

 There are three types of safe mode options available in advanced boot options:

* **Safe Mode:** Windows starts with a minimal set of drivers and files and disables everything else.
* **Safe Mode with Networking:** Windows starts with a basic set of drivers in addition to the network drivers necessary to connect to a network or the Internet. Wi-Fi connectivity is not available in this mode.
* **Safe Mode with Command Prompt:** For advanced users who want to access the Command Prompt in safe mode and don’t need the Windows graphical interface.

## 1\. Boot into Safe Mode Using the Microsoft System Configuration Utility

 You can boot into safe mode using the System Configuration utility, which is less intimidating than other methods. Another advantage is that it allows you to configure your desired safe mode (Standard, Networking, Command Prompt) before restarting and also automatically set your computer to boot into safe mode on the next restart.

 To boot into safe mode using the System Configuration utility:

1. Press **Win + R** to open **Run**, type **msconfig** and click **OK**. Alternatively, click **Start**, type **System Configuration** and open the best matching result.
2. In the **System Configuration** window, open the **Boot** tab.

3. Under **Boot options**, select **Safe boot**. By default, the default mode is set to **Minimal**. Depending on your requirements, you can switch between **Alternate Shell (Command Prompt)**, **Network** or **Active Directory repair** options.

2. Type **msconfig** and click **OK** to open the **System Configuration.**
3. In the **Boot** tab, uncheck the **Safe boot** option.
