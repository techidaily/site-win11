 Once you have your new admin account set up, log in with it and launch Command Prompt again as an administrator - this should fix the issue. When you still can't get it to run, try restarting your computer before trying any of the other solutions listed here.

## 4\. Check for Any New Windows Updates

 Windows Update is a critical component of keeping your computer up to date. As such, if Command Prompt fails to run as an administrator, check for any new Windows updates.

 To do this, open your Start menu, then type "Check for updates" in the search bar. Afterward, click on the search result and install any pending updates found. Once you have done so, restart your computer, and Command Prompt should work properly.

## 5\. Perform a System Restore

 If you have recently made changes to Command Prompt, and they seem to be causing the issue, you can try performing a system restore. This will revert your computer back to a previous point in time when Command Prompt was still working properly.
