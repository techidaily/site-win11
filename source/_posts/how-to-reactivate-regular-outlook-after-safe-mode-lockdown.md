## How To Reactivate Regular Outlook After Safe Mode Lockdown

 Opening Outlook in safe mode can help you diagnose and fix a variety of issues with the app. However, it can be confusing if Microsoft Outlook is only accessible in safe mode. Fortunately, there’s no need to settle for a subpar experience, as it is possible to fix this issue.

 In this guide, we've put together a few troubleshooting tips that'll restore the Outlook app to normalcy.

## 1\. Disable Outlook Add-Ins

 Although Outlook add-ins can be useful, they may not always function properly. It’s possible that a conflicting add-in is causing Outlook to open in safe mode repeatedly. To check for this possibility, you can disable all your add-ins and then try to open the Outlook app again.

To disable add-ins in Outlook:

1. In the Outlook app, click the**File** menu at the top.
2. Select**Options** from the left pane.
3. In the Outlook Options window, select**Add-ins** from the left sidebar.
4. Click the**Go** button next to**COM Add-ins** .
5. Clear all the checkboxes to disable your add-ins.
6. Click**OK** to save changes.  
![Disable Outlook Add-Ins-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/disable-outlook-add-ins-1.jpg)

 Restart the Outlook app after this and see if it opens in normal mode. If this solves your problem, it means the add-in which was causing the problem got disabled. To identify it, you can re-enable your add-ins one at a time until the problem occurs again. Once you've identified the problematic add-in, you may want to remove it to avoid such issues in the future.

## 2\. Reset Outlook Navigation Pane

 With Microsoft Outlook, you can customize the navigation pane to easily access different parts of the app. However, a startup issue with the navigation pane can sometimes force Outlook to open in safe mode only. You can try resetting Outlook’s navigation pane and see if that fixes the issue.

1. Press**Win + R** to the Run dialog box.
2. Type**outlook.exe /resetnavpane** in the Open field and press**Enter** .

When this happens,[Outlook may keep crashing](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-outlook-crashing-windows/) or trouble you with such issues.
