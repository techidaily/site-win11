## 1\. Check Your ISP's Data Plan

 Even if Windows shows the Limited access message when you connect to the Wi-Fi, there’s a chance you don’t have any system or connectivity issues.

 Depending on your ISP (or Internet Service Provider), you might have limited or unlimited data. If you have a data cap, and you exceed it, your Wi-Fi network might show limited access once you connect to it.

 You can check how much data you’ve used through Windows Settings. Press**Win + I** to bring up the Settings menu. Head to **Network & Internet > Advanced network settings > Data usage** . There, check your data usage and compare it with your data cap.

## 2\. Turn Off the Metered Connection Feature

 In case you’ve set up a metered connection to make sure you’re not going over your data cap, the Wi-Fi will show limited access if you’ve reached the limit. Now, if you no longer need Windows to keep an eye on your data usage you should disable the metered connection.

1. Right-click the**Start** button and go to**Settings** .
2. From the right pane, select**Network & internet > Wi-Fi** .
3. Select the network you’re connected to.
4. Turn off the**Metered connection** option.

 Right-click the network adapter and open the**Power management** tab. There, uncheck the**Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power** option.

## 9\. Reset Your Network

 When dealing with the Wi-Fi network showing limited access, it might be difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. If you’ve gone through the above instruction but didn’t find anything wrong with your system setting, you should reset the network.

 This way, Windows will revert network settings to their default values and reinstall all the network adapters.

Go through the following steps to reset the network:

1. Press**Win + I** to bring up Windows Settings.
2. Go to**Network & internet >** **Advanced network settings** .
3. Head to the**More settings** section and click**Network reset** .
4. Click the**Reset now** button.
