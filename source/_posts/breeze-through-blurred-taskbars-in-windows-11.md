## Breeze Through Blurred Taskbars in Windows 11

 Is an opaque taskbar ruining your desktop appearance? If you’ve tried hiding the taskbar but it didn’t fit your preferences, there’s one more solution for you to try. Make the taskbar transparent.

 We’ll show you how you can make the taskbar partially transparent via Windows Settings. If you want it to be fully transparent, you can edit the Registry or use a third-party app.

## 1\. Tweak Windows Settings

 You can [customize the Windows 11 taskbar](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-customize-taskbar/) and add a transparency effect by changing your system settings. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Press**Windows key + I** to launch Windows Settings.
2. Head to**Personalization > Colors** .
3. Enable the toggle next to**Transparency effects** .

 If your taskbar is still opaque, there’s one more change you need to do. In the Settings window, click**Accessibility** , and go to**Visual effects** . There, enable**Transparency effects** .

 If you’re still not satisfied with the level of transparency, there are a couple more methods you can use.

## 2\. Use a Registry Tweak

 Another way to make the taskbar transparent in Windows 11 is to edit the Windows Registry. Before doing so,[manually create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) in case something goes wrong, and you need to revert your system to a previous state.

Follow these steps to edit the Registry:

1. Launch Registry Editor with administrative rights.
2. In the Registry window, head to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE > SOFTWARE > Microsoft > Windows > CurrentVersion > Explorer > Advanced** .
3. In the right pane, right-click anywhere on the empty space and select**New > DWORD (32-bit) value** .
4. Name it**UseOLEDTaskbarTransparency** and set the**Value data** to**1** .
5. Close the Registry and restart your computer.
