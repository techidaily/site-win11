##  Ways to Delete Whitespace in Excel

 In Excel, to remove the leading, trailing, and extra spaces between words in a particular string, [use the TRIM function](https://graphic-issues.techidaily.com/regaining-access-to-nvidia-writable-displays/). This function deletes all spaces except for single spaces between words.

 To remove all spaces, including the ones between words, use Excel's Replace feature. You can quickly do this across your entire spreadsheet, or limit it to a specific area.

##  Remove Leading, Trailing, and Extra Whitespaces in Excel

 To start removing the leading, trailing, and extra whitespaces from your cells, first, open your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel. We will use the following spreadsheet that has extra spaces.

![An Excel spreadsheet with extra spaces.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-extra-space-spreadsheet.png) 

 Select the cell next to the first record in your spreadsheet. This is where your text without the extra spaces will appear.

![Select the cell next to the first record.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-select-cell-1.png) 

 In the selected cell, type the following `TRIM` function and press Enter. In the function, replace

        `B2`
    
 with the cell where your first record is.

=TRIM(B2)

![Enter the TRIM function in the cell.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-enter-trim-function.png) 

 From the bottom-right corner of where you typed the `TRIM` function, [drag down so the formula is copied](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-5-best-hdmi-21-gaming-monitors-ps5-compatible/) for all your records.
