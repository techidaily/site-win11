 Before we dig in, let's see what Device Usage Options are and how they affect your Windows experience.

## What Are the Device Usage Options on Windows?

 Device Usage Options allow you to customize your Windows experience by setting preferences for how ads are displayed. Microsoft also provides tips & suggestions and personalizes recommendations for you. Depending on your choice, Windows presents you with different types of information and services.

* **Business:** Do you want to use your device for work? With this option, Windows offers tips on managing your business, tracking expenses, and providing customer service.

 Now that you know what Device Usage Options are, here's how to change them in Windows.

## 1\. Using Windows Settings

 Changing Device Usage Options on Windows is easy. There are two ways to do it - using System Settings or through a reg file. First, let's look at how to change Device Usage Options using Windows Settings.

 To get started, press **Win + I** on your keyboard. This will open the System Settings. From the left sidebar, click on the **Personalisation** tab. Scroll down in the right pane and click **Device usage**.

 On the next page, look for your preferred Device Usage option and toggle it on.

## 2\. Using a REG File

 If you're [unable to open the System Settings window or if it isn't working](https://www.makeuseof.com/fixes-unable-to-open-windows-settings/), use a reg file instead. A reg file is a registry key file that helps you tweak Windows settings.

### Gaming Device Usage Options

 To create a reg file for your desired Device Usage Options, [open Notepad](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-notepad/) and copy-paste the following:

`Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudExperienceHost\Intent\gaming]  
"Intent"=dword:00000001  
"Priority"=dword:00000000  
  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudExperienceHost\Intent\OffDeviceConsent]  
"accepted"=dword:00000001`

 Now click the **File** menu and select **Save as** from the options list. Choose **All files** from the **Save as type** drop-down menu and save it with a **.reg** extension to your desktop.

 To apply the settings, double-click the reg file. This will turn on the Device usage options for Gaming.

 If you want to turn off this option, create a new reg file and paste the following:

`Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudExperienceHost\Intent\gaming]  
"Intent"=dword:00000000`

 Now save it with the **.reg** extension as above and double-click to apply.

 To turn on Device usage options for other categories, create separate reg files with the corresponding code then apply them in the same way. Here's a list of each .reg file's contents:

### Family Device Usage Options

`Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudExperienceHost\Intent\family]

"Priority"=dword:00000000  
  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudExperienceHost\Intent\OffDeviceConsent]  
"accepted"=dword:00000001`

"Priority"=dword:00000000  
  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudExperienceHost\Intent\OffDeviceConsent]  
"accepted"=dword:00000001`

### School Device Usage Options

"Intent"=dword:00000001  
"Priority"=dword:00000000  
  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudExperienceHost\Intent\OffDeviceConsent]  
"accepted"=dword:00000001`

### Entertainment Device Usage Options

 If you want the Entertainment options:

`Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudExperienceHost\Intent\entertainment]  
"Intent"=dword:00000001  
"Priority"=dword:00000000  
  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudExperienceHost\Intent\OffDeviceConsent]  
"accepted"=dword:00000001`

### Business Device Usage Options

 And finally, for the Business side of things:

`Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudExperienceHost\Intent\business]  
"Intent"=dword:00000001  
"Priority"=dword:00000000  
  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudExperienceHost\Intent\OffDeviceConsent]  
"accepted"=dword:00000001`
