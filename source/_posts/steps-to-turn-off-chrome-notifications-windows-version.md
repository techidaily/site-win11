## Steps to Turn Off Chrome Notifications, Windows Version

 Although Google Chrome notifications keep you up to date on the latest news, emails, messages, and more, irrelevant notifications from websites can get annoying very fast.

 Thankfully, it's quite easy to disable Google Chrome notifications on Windows. You can either block Chrome notifications for a few specific websites or turn them off entirely. In this post, we’ll show you how to do both.

## How to Turn Off Google Chrome Notifications From Windows Settings

 The Windows Settings app lets you enable or[disable notifications for each of your apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/selectively-disable-app-notifications-windows-10/) separately. If you do not want to receive any notifications from Google Chrome, you can disable its notification permission on Windows. Here's how you can go about it.

1. Open the Start menu and click the gear icon or use the**Win + I** keyboard shortcut to[launch the Settings app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) .
2. Navigate to**System > Notifications** .
3. Scroll down to the**Notifications from apps and other senders** section.
4. Locate**Google Chrome** on the app list and disable the toggle next to it.

## How to Turn Off Notifications for Specific Sites in Google Chrome

 Not all notifications are useless. If you don't wish to disable Google Chrome notifications entirely, you can disable them for specific websites. To do so, open Google Chrome and navigate to the website for which you want to disable notifications. Click the**padlock icon** on the left of the website URL at the top. Then, toggle off the switch next to**Notifications** .

 The method outlined above is ideal if you only want to disable notifications for one or two websites. However, if you want to turn off Chrome notifications for several websites, you can visit the notifications section in Chrome settings. Here are the steps you need to follow.

1. Open Google Chrome on your PC.
2. Click the**menu icon** in the top right corner to open**Settings** .
3. Navigate to **Privacy and security > Site Settings > Notifications** .
4. Click the**Add** button next to**Not allowed to send notifications** .
5. Enter the URL of the website for which you want to turn off notifications and click on**Add** .

 If you've previously enabled notifications for any sites, you’ll find them under the**Allowed to send notifications** section. To disable notifications for those websites, click the**three-dot menu icon** next to the website URL and select**Block** .
