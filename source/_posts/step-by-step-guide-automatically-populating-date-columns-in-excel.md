 If you want to fill sequential dates in your spreadsheet cells, you don't have to type them manually. Microsoft Excel offers two ways to quickly and [automatically fill dates in your chosen cells](https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-change-location-on-facebook-dating-for-your-honor-magic-6-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). We'll show you how to use those methods.

 In both these methods, you enter the first date in a cell in your spreadsheet. Then, based on this date, Excel automatically populates the other cells with sequential dates. You get the same results regardless of what fill method you use below. However, the Fill Command method gives you control over the date unit counted.
