## Guide for Reviving a Stuck Download Space on Windows OS

 The Downloads folder serves as the storage location for all internet downloads on Windows. From there, you can access and manage all the files you have obtained from the web. However, this may not be possible if the Downloads folder stops responding on your Windows computer.

 Below, we have listed some effective troubleshooting tips that should get the Downloads folder to work smoothly on your Windows computer.

## 1\. Restart the Windows Explorer Process

 Restarting the Windows Explorer process is an easy way to fix temporary issues with File Explorer. If it’s just a one-off glitch, this should get the Downloads folder to operate smoothly on your PC.

1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open the Task Manager.
2. In the **Processes** tab, locate **Windows Explorer**. Right-click on it and select **Restart**.

 Your taskbar will disappear for a moment and then reappear. Following this, open the Downloads folder and see if it works fine.

## 2\. Optimize the Downloads Folder for General Items

 The Automatic Folder Type Discovery feature in Windows optimizes your folders depending on the file types they contain. However, this optimization can sometimes result in slow or unresponsive behavior, especially when there are a large number of files in the folder. Here’s what you can do to avoid that.

1. Open File Explorer on your PC.
2. Right-click on the **Downloads** folder and select **Properties**.
3. Switch to the **Customize** tab.
4. Click the drop-down menu under **Customize this folder for** and select **General items**.
5. Hit **Apply** followed by **OK**.

## 3\. Configure File Explorer to Display Icons Instead of Thumbnails

 Another thing you can do to get the Downloads folder to work smoothly is to configure File Explorer to display icons rather than thumbnails. Here are the steps for the same.

1. Press **Win + S** to access the search menu.
2. Type **file explorer options** in the text box and press **Enter**.
3. Under the **View** tab, tick the **Always show icons, never thumbnails** checkbox.
4. Hit **Apply** followed by **OK**.  
![Disable Thumbnails in File Explorer](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/disable-thumbnails-in-file-explorer.jpg)

 Remember that this setting will apply to all folders on your system, not just the Downloads folder.

## 4\. Delete Unwanted Files From the Downloads Folder

 Having an excessive number of files in the Downloads folder can cause it to become stuck and not respond on your Windows computer. Several [users on the Microsoft forums reported](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/download-folder-isnt-responding/f3697c5e-90fa-40a0-a30f-ad63b2a4c194) fixing the unresponsive Downloads folder by deleting unnecessary files from it. Alternatively, you can [move your files](http://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-move-files-windows-11/) to a different location to free up the Downloads folder.

## 5\. Clear File Explorer History

 File Explorer on Windows keeps a record of all of your previous search queries to enhance your experience. However, if this data becomes inaccessible, the Downloads folder may stop responding on Windows. You can try purging this data to see if that gets things moving again.

1. Click the **magnifying icon** on the taskbar.
2. Type **file explorer options** in the box and select the first result that appears.
3. Under the **General** tab, click the **Clear** button next to **Clear File Explorer history**.

## 6\. Try Some Generic Fixes for an Unresponsive Downloads Folder

 If the Downloads folder still won’t respond, you can try your luck with the following troubleshooting tips to restore normalcy.

* **Run an SFC Scan:** If your PC has corrupt or damaged system files, it can disrupt Windows processes and lead to such anomalies. To fix this, you can [run the SFC (System File Checker) scan](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/) to repair problematic system files.
* **Scan for Malware:** The presence of malware on your system can also cause such issues with the Downloads folder. To check for this possibility, you can try [scanning your PC for malware using PowerShell](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-powershell-to-scan-windows-10-for-malware/) or Microsoft Defender.
* **Install Windows Updates:** A buggy or outdated Windows build could interfere with File Explorer processes and cause the Downloads folder to misbehave. Hence, it’s a good idea to [install any pending Windows updates](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-install-updates/) and see if that helps.
* **Perform a System Restore:** It’s possible that recent changes made to your system are causing the Downloads folder to freeze repeatedly. If that’s the case, you can [use System Restore to revert Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/use-system-restore-windows/) to its earlier state to fix the problem.
