## Decode Widows' Code to Unfreeze HandBrake

 HandBrake is a powerful video transcoder tool packed with useful features. The tool converts videos from various source formats to MP4 or MKV and resizes them accordingly. It takes time and effort to master HandBrake, but once you've got the hang of it, you'll never look back.

 However, like any software, HandBrake can run into technical issues. If you are having trouble opening HandBrake on your Windows system, check out this guide.

## 1\. Check the System Requirements

 If you're experiencing issues opening HandBrake on your Windows computer, be sure to check the system requirements first. The computer must meet the minimum hardware and software prerequisites to run HandBrake properly. Here's a concise overview of HandBrake's system requirements:

* **Processor:** Opt for a system equipped with an **Intel Core i3** processor or more advanced. Alternatively, an **AMD FX or 2014+ APU** can serve the job effectively.
* **Memory:** The amount of free memory required varies depending on the video resolution you're transcoding. For standard definition videos (480p/576p), a minimum of **512MB** is necessary. High-definition videos (720p/1080p) demand at least **1.5GB**, and for transcoding ultra-high-definition videos (2160p 4K), ensure your system carries **4GB** or more free memory.
* **System Storage:** The HandBrake application itself requires a minimal **100MB**. However, it is advisable to have **2GB** or more storage space available for processing and storing your new videos.
* **Display Resolution:** Your system should support a minimum display resolution of **1024x768**. If you're using display scaling, this requirement increases proportionally.

 If your Windows system meets these specifications, HandBrake will function smoothly.

## 2\. Restart Your Computer

 If the system requirements are in line, [restart your Windows computer](http://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/) and relaunch HandBrake. The process clears temporary files and terminates background processes that could disrupt HandBrake's functionality.

 Though it may seem simple, this initial step often resolves the issue, saving you from further troubleshooting.

## 3\. Try Running HandBrake as an Administrator

 HandBrake requires administrative privileges to perform some of its functions. So, if restarting the computer doesn't work, run HandBrake as an administrator. Here's how to do it:

1. Press **Win + D** to go to the desktop.
2. Right-click the HandBrake icon and select **Run as administrator**.
3. If the UAC pops up on the screen, click **Yes** to proceed.

 After following these steps, launch HandBrake and transcode a video. If it works, then it is fine to use. To avoid this problem later, [set the app to always run as an administrator on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/always-run-apps-administrator-windows/).

## 4\. Update HandBrake to the Latest Version

 If the issue persists and you can't open HandBrake, update the app to the latest version. HandBrake developers regularly release updates with bug fixes and performance improvements.

 To update HandBrake to the latest version, download the installer file from the official website. Here's how to do it:

1. Open your web browser and [visit the official HandBrake website](https://handbrake.fr/).
2. Click on the **Download HandBrake** button. The download should start automatically.
3. Next, navigate to your **Downloads** folder or to the location you've set for downloading.
4. Double-click the installer file to launch the HandBrake setup wizard. If prompted, click **Yes**.
5. A window might pop up asking you to confirm the action. Click **Yes** and follow the prompts in the installation wizard. You just need to click the **Next** button a few times and then **Install**.
