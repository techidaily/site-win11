## A Step-by-Step Approach to Recover Your Windows Apps

 Sometimes, there’s just no easy way of saving an app when it's not working properly on Windows. In a last-ditch effort, you can try to fix it by uninstalling and reinstalling it, meaning you’ll lose any data and settings associated with the app. You can reset some apps from within the Settings app, allowing Windows to return them to their default state.

 So how do you reset an app on Windows? Here’s what you need to know.

## How to Reset an App on Windows 11

 To reset an app on Windows 11, start by pressing**Win + I** to bring up the Settings app. Then, navigate to**Apps > Installed apps** .

 Scroll through the list of apps on your computer until you get to the one you want. Once you’ve found it, click on the**three horizontal dots** on its right and select**Advanced options** from the menu.

## Windows Apps Just Need a Reset Sometimes

 If you don’t want the hassle of manually reinstalling an app, you can let Windows do it for you in the Settings app. Since this will be like installing a fresh copy of the app, be sure to reset it only when you’ve tried other ways to save the program.

 If you can’t reset an app in Settings, then you have to manually reinstall it.
