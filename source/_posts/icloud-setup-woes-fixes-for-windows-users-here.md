## 1\. Install the Media Feature Pack

 One unusual reason why you might be unable to install iCloud is if Windows Media Player is missing or disabled on your PC. In that case, you might get the error message "Your computer is missing media features" while installing iCloud.

 To fix this, simply click the **Download** button when the “Install Media Feature Pack to use iCloud” dialog appears, and then follow the on-screen prompts to finish the installation process. After that, you should be able to install iCloud on your PC.

## 2\. Turn On Media Features

 The iCloud app relies on Windows Media Player to play audio and video files on your computer. If you have previously disabled Media Features on your PC, iCloud won't install unless you re-enable them.

 To turn on Media Features on Windows:

1. Press **Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type **control panel** in the box and press **Enter**.
3. Click on **Programs and Features**.
4. Click the **Turn Windows features on or off** link in the left pane.
5. Tick the checkboxes next to **Media Features** and **Windows Media Player**.
6. Click **OK** to save changes.

[Restart your PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/) after completing the above steps, and then try to install iCloud again.

## 3\. Remove the Previous Version of iCloud

 Another reason why you may have trouble installing iCloud from the Microsoft Store is if an older version of the app is already available on your PC. If that’s the case, you will need to remove the previous version of iCloud to fix the issue. Here’s how you can go about it.

1. Press **Win + R** to [open the Run dialog box](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/).
2. Type **appwiz.cpl** and press **Enter**.
3. In the Programs and Features window, locate and select **iCloud**.
4. Click the **Change** button at the top.
5. Select **Remove** and click **Next**.
