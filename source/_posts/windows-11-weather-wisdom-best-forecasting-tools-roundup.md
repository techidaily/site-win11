## Windows 11 Weather Wisdom: Best Forecasting Tools Roundup

 MyRadar may not be as popular amongst Windows users, but it has over 50 million downloads on iOS and Android platforms. It is a weather forecast app that displays animated weather radar for your current location.

 You can select your region or view other parts of the map with scroll-to-zoom. With the region selected, click on the Forecast icon to view the temperature, Air Quality Index, and precipitation forecast at a glance.
