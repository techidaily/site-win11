Download the Samsung Flow app from the [Microsoft Store](http://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/samsung-flow/9NBLGGH5GB0M) on your Windows computer and from the [Google Play Store](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2029368/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.galaxycontinuity) on your Galaxy phone.
2. Open the app on both devices and make sure both are connected to the same Wi-Fi or LAN network. On your Windows PC, click **Start** to begin pairing the two devices.
3. Next, you'll see the name of your Galaxy phone appear in the list of devices that are available to register. Tap it to continue.

 You can register up to three tablets or PCs on Samsung Flow.

 Once both devices are paired, you can easily share photos, videos, documents, audio files, contacts, text messages, and more between them using the Add button (plus icon).

 Files received via Samsung Flow will automatically be stored in a separate folder on your Windows PC and Galaxy phone, but you can change the location of the downloads manually via the app settings.

 Pin Samsung Flow to your Windows taskbar for quicker access.

 If you plan to use Samsung Flow often, it's wise to select **Always auto connect to \[device name\]** if prompted on your Galaxy phone. Without it, you'll have to click **Verify identity** on your Windows PC every time you want to connect it to your Galaxy phone.

 If you missed the pop-up, you can also set up auto connect by following these steps:

1. Open the Samsung Flow app on your Galaxy phone.
2. Tap the **More options** (three-dots) menu and select **Manage devices**.
3. Tap the settings icon beside the registered device of your choice.
4. Tap **Verification method** and select **Auto connection** from the dropdown menu. You can also select **Biometrics** if you want the app to require your fingerprint before connecting to Windows, adding a layer of security.
