## Push The Envelope with These 8 Customizations by WinBubble

 The default customization options within Windows 11 and 10 are relatively limited. However, some third-party software packages give you lots more options for customizing Microsoft’s desktop operating system. WinBubble is freeware customization software that enables you to tweak the Windows platform in many different ways. Here are eight ways you can tweak Windows 11/10 with WinBubble.

## First, Download and Extract WinBubble

 The latest version of WinBubble is primarily designed for customizing Windows 10\. Its WinBubble for Windows 10 title makes it clear what platform it’s intended for. There are older versions of the software for Windows 7 and Vista.

 You can still tweak Windows 11 with WinBubble. However, some of its customization settings may not work right in Microsoft’s latest desktop OS. So, consider[creating a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) backup before utilizing WinBubble in Windows 11.

 WinBubble is a portable app, meaning it doesn’t have an installer. It downloads as a ZIP archive you’ll need to extract before running the software.

 To get the ZIP file, open the[WinBubble for Windows 10](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/System-Tweak/WinBubble.shtml) Softpedia page and select**Download Now** \>**Softpedia Mirror (US)** .

 You can extract the archive as covered in our guide on[how to unzip files on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/unzip-files-windows-10/) . Double-click**WinBubble.exe** in the extracted WinBubbles directory to open the software.

## 1\. How to Customize Desktop Shortcut Icons With WinBubble

 The icons for desktop shortcuts on Windows include little arrows on them. However, you can change that with WinBubble’s Customize Shortcut Icon option. That option enables you to remove the arrow or change it to a star, heart, or Windows logo. You can tweak the desktop shortcut icons like this:

1. Select WinBubble’s**Specific** tab.
2. Then click the**Customize Shortcut Icon** drop-down menu to select a**No Arrow** ,**Heart** ,**Star** , or**Win** (Windows logo) option.  
![The Customize Shortcut Icon drop-down menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/customize-shortcut-icon-drop-down-menu.jpg)
3. Press the**Set** button.
4. Click**OK** on the dialog box that prompts a restart.
5. Then you’ll need to restart Windows for this customization to take effect.

## 2\. How to Customize Windows’ Screensavers With WinBubble

 Windows 10 and 11 include Bubbles, Mystify, and Ribbon screensavers, but there aren’t any customization options for them. You can tweak those screensavers by manually editing the registry. However, WinBubble’s customization settings for the Bubbles, Mystify, and Ribbon screensavers make life easier for us.

 The**Specific** tab in WinBubble includes the options for tweaking those screensavers. You can change presets for the screensavers by clicking their**Preset** drop-down menus and selecting alternative options.

 For example, you can select**Glassy Bubbles** or**Metallic Bubbles** options with different sizes for the Bubbles screensaver. Selecting the**Metallic Bubbles** option will give you multicolored bubbles shown in the snapshot below.

![Metallic bubbles screensaver](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/metallic-bubbles.jpg)

 You can also adjust the number of ribbons or lines for the different**Ribbon** and**Mystify** screensaver presets. Select a preset and then input values in the number boxes to change how many lines or ribbons are included in the screensavers. You can also input a width value in the**Ribbon** **width** box.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 When you’ve customized a screensaver, click the**View** button to preview it. Select**Set** to save the settings. You might also need to select and set the customized screensaver in the Change screensaver Control Panel applet.

## 3\. How to Change the Menu Delay With WinBubble

 You can speed up menus a bit by reducing the menu delay. By default, Windows has a 400-millisecond menu delay, which you can cut to zero. WinBubble includes a**Menu Show Delay** option you can configure among numerous other optimization settings.

 To configure that setting, select the**Optimize** tab. Click the**Menu Show Delay** option to choose a value less than 400; select**Apply** to save the new value.

 While you’re at it, you can also speed up the Window shutdown process a little. To do this, select WinBubble’s**Decrease Shutdown Time for services** and**Do not Clear Pagefile at Shutdown** checkboxes on the same**Optimize** tab.

## 4\. How to Add New Submenus to the Context Menu

 WinBubble includes lots of customization settings for the desktop context menu in Windows. It enables you to add three alternative shortcut submenus to the desktop context menu. You can select to add context menu submenus for opening Control Panel applets, Microsoft apps, and system tools.

 Click the**General** tab to view those customization settings for the context menu. Select a**Control Panel Menu** ,**MS Software Menu** , or**System Tools Menu** option on that tab to add one of those submenus. Click**Run** on any Open File warning dialog box to apply.

![The submenu context menu settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/context-menu-settings.jpg)

 Then right-click a desktop area to view your new**Control Panel** ,**System Tool** , or**Software** submenus. In Windows 11, you’ll also need to click**Show more options** since this tweak is applied to the classic context menu. Each submenu includes a variety of handy shortcuts.

## 5\. How to Add New Take Ownership Explorer Options for Files and Folders

 You can’t open folders with restricted access unless you take ownership of them in Windows 11/10\. To manually take ownership of a folder, you’ll need to change its security settings via its properties window.

 However, it’s much simpler to add options for taking ownership of folders and files to the context menu with WinBubble. Then you can right-click a folder or file in Explorer to select a**Take the Ownership** option.

1. Select the**Control Panel** radio button.
2. Press the**ellipsis** button for the**File/Folder** box on the**Tools** tab.
3. Choose a program to include on the Control Panel.

## 8\. How to Disable the Registry Editor in WinBubble

 The**More Policies** tab in WinBubble enables you to disable many things in Windows. It incorporates four subtabs from which you can disable desktop, Start menu, taskbar, machine, system, and Control Panel features.

 For example, you can select to disable the Registry Editor if you don’t want other users messing around with the registry. To do so, click the**More Policies** \>**System** tabs.
