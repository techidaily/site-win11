## Why Is the Mouse Lagging in Battlefront 2?

 A laggy or stuttering mouse can completely hinder your Battlefront 2 experience on Windows. There are a handful of reasons that could cause it. But among them, the primary culprits are:

1. There's something wrong with the USB hub you are using to connect the mouse to the computer.
2. The issue can result due to a conflict between Battlefront 2 and third-party software installed on your computer.
3. You may also face the problem if the mouse pointer trails feature is enabled.

 Regardless of what's causing the problem, you can quickly fix a laggy mouse by following the below fixes.

## 1\. Eliminate Any Hardware Issues

 First of all, ensure that your mouse isn't to blame. Sometimes, a mouse may not work properly if it is connected to your computer via a USB hub. Connect the mouse directly to a different USB port of your computer and check if it fixes the issue.

 If the problem continues, connect your external mouse to another computer and check if you still experience lag while accessing applications. A low battery level on a wireless mouse can also be behind this issue.

## 2\. Check for a Third-party Software Conflict

 Sometimes, a third-party app installed on your computer can cause the mouse to malfunction. You can narrow down the conflicting software by performing a clean boot. If you're not sure how to do that, check out[how to perform a clean boot on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/) .

 In the Clean Boot state, Windows boots with only the essential set of drivers and programs. Start the system in clean boot and play Battlefront 2 to check if the mouse continues to lag.

 Once you determine the problem is being caused due to third-party software, identify and uninstall the program to eliminate the problem. To begin with, disable third-party startup apps on your computer, as covered in[how to disable start-up apps in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-disable-startup-programs/) . This includes customization tools, mods, and gaming overlays.

 Disable all the programs one by one to narrow down the problematic app and then uninstall it to see if that helps you fix the mouse lag problem in Battlefront 2.

## 3\. Turn Off the Mouse Pointer Trails Feature

![Pointer Trails option in Settings menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Pointer-Trails-option-.jpg)

 Mouse pointer trail is an accessibility feature using which you can quickly track the cursor as you move it around your computer screen. However, it adds a glitchy effect, making you feel that the cursor is stuttering.

 The solution, in this case, is to disable the pointer trail feature. Here's how:

1. Open the Settings menu by pressing**Win + I** hotkeys.
2. Choose the**Accessibility** option at the left panel.
3. Under the**Vision** section, select the**Mouse pointer and touch.**
4. Select**Mouse** under**Related settings.**
5. Choose**Additional mouse settings.**
6. Switch to the**Pointer Options** tab.
7. In the**Visibility** section, uncheck the**Display pointer trails** box.
8. Click**Apply** and then**OK** to save the changes.

## 4\. Disable Mouse Acceleration in Windows

 The mouse acceleration feature helps in making the inputs smoother. To be specific, this feature controls how fast the mouse moves across the screen.

 You can disable this feature to fix the mouse lag issue in Battlefront 2\. Here's how:

1. Open the Run dialog box (see[how to open Run](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) ), type**main.cpl** and click**OK** . It'll open the**Mouse Properties.**
2. Switch to the**Pointer Options** tab.
3. In the**Motion** section, uncheck the**Enhance** **pointer precision.**
4. Click Apply > OK.

 That's it. Restart your computer and check if the problem continues. If yes, try the next solution on the list.

## 5 . Disable Overlays

 An overlay usually lets you quickly capture gameplay and chat with your friends. But sometimes, it can also be the reason why the mouse is lagging in Battlefront 2.

 Its quite likely that AMD Radeon or Nvidia GeForce Experience overlay feature is enabled on your computer if you own one of their graphics cards.

 Also, check the game launcher you are using to play Battlefront 2\. For instance, if you have installed the game via Origin, make sure its overlay is disabled.

 Launch the game and check for the issue. If you still experience the mouse lag, then you can re-enable the overlays, but chances are it will eliminate the problem.

## 6\. Turn Off the Windows Transparency Effect

1. Open the Settings menu (see[how to open Settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) ) and choose the Accessibility option.
2. Choose**Visual effects.**
3. Disable the toggle next to**Transparency effects.**

## 7\. Download the Latest Graphics Driver Update
