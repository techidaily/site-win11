## Five Superior Tools Excluding the Standard Windows Snipper

 The Windows Sniping tool is handy; however, you can do much more with your screen captures thanks to numerous available alternative tools. We’ll explore a number of them in this article, so you can make an informed choice on what works best for you.

 But first, here are some things you should look out for when choosing a screen capture tool.

## What Makes a Great Screen Capture Tool?

 So, why should you bother downloading a third-party app to replace something built into Windows? There are a few areas in which third-party tool excels.

### 1\. Ease of Use

 Nothing beats ease when it comes to finding an app/tool that works for you. So, you want to look out for one with a simple interface, just like the Windows Snip tool. This will allow you to make use of its features easily to get optimum results.

### 2\. Integration with Other Apps

 A good screen capture tool should be one that integrates seamlessly with other apps. This makes it easier to share and upload on other platforms.

### 3\. Editing Tools

 Most screenshot tools come with an image editor, and the best ones have a variety of edit options. So, you can adjust your image to make it better suited for whatever purposes you have in mind. For example, adding annotations to an image can make it more illustrative, which can be great for visual guides.

### 4\. Additional Features

 Most screen capture tools do one thing very well; taking awesome screenshots. However, some tools offer other options outside basic screen captures, which can be pretty effective for different use cases. For example, some of these applications make great[screen recording apps for Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-screen-recording-programs/) and feature cloud-sharing capabilities.

 We can all agree that the Windows Snipping tool is relatively limited in its features, so here are some alternatives you might want to explore:

## 1\. Greenshot

![Screenshot Showing Greenshot Image Editor](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-showing-greenshot-image-editor.jpg)

 Greenshot is a free, easy-to-use software alternative to the Windows Snipping tool. Its straightforward design is most suitable for people who need a basic screen capture tool with key editing features.

 Once downloaded, clicking the print screen key will open up the menu options for screen capture. However, the tool allows you to change the key shortcuts in the image editor settings.

 Greenshot not only lets you capture a full screen, specific window, or region of your screen, but it also has a feature to capture the last area you took a snapshot from. This could come in handy if you need to take multiple snapshots of the same area, so you won’t have to drag your mouse over it repeatedly.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 It features an image editor that contains customization tools for your captures. Though simple, Greenshot takes editing a step further with more editing options, especially when compared to the Windows Snipping tool.

 You can add a text box or speech bubble to your image, as well as Greyscale, Border, and Drop Shadow effects, among others. It also includes an obfuscate tool that can be used to blur out parts you’d like to keep out of your image.

 Greenshot integrates well with other apps on your PC so that you can export an image seamlessly. For example, you can open up your image easily in Outlook to email it as a file attachment or send it directly to other compatible apps to work on without having to copy and paste.

## 2\. ShareX

![Screenshot Showing ShareX Software Application](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-showing-sharex-software-application.jpg)

 ShareX is another free alternative to the Windows Snipping tool with numerous efficient uses.

 More than a screen capture app, ShareX is also a screen recorder, so you can capture video recordings of your screen activity. This can be particularly useful for making videos and how-tos. You can also create GIFs from your captures.

 With ShareX, you get a lot more capture options than the Windows Snipping tool. Apart from the common Fullscreen and Window capture, it includes Region capture (in different modes), Auto capture (you can set a timer to take repeated snapshots of a page) as well as scrolling capture for webpages.

 Furthermore, the app has additional image editing tools you wouldn’t get on the Windows Snipping tool. One such is the[clipboard manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-clipboard-manager/) , which lets you see the list of images you’ve copied to your clipboard.

 Another is the borderless window tool which helps you exclude taskbar borders from a window, so you can take a full snapshot without having to crop out those parts. You also have an image thumbnail maker, image splitter, and image combiner.

 Additionally, the ShareX application features an**after-capture** and**after-upload** tasks menu, which consists of various actions you can perform in-app. This allows you to upload your image to several image-sharing platforms, such as Imgur.

 Overall, Greenshot is a great app with a host of configuration settings. Consequently, if you are looking to do more than capture screenshots, this is a good choice.
