## Windows Methods for Engaging WordPad

 WordPad is a basic word-processing program that comes installed on most Windows PCs. The program allows you to create and edit documents, but it lacks some of the more advanced features of other word-editing applications. Despite its limited features, WordPad can be a helpful tool for quickly creating and editing simple documents.

 If you're new to Windows, you may not know how to open WordPad. Here are some quick and easy ways to launch WordPad on your Windows PC.

## 1\. How to Open WordPad Using the Windows Search Tool

## 4\. How to Open WordPad Using the Task Manager

 Task Manager is a built-in application on Windows that provides users with information about the processes and programs running on their computers. It's not only useful for monitoring a computer's performance and ending unresponsive applications, but you can also launch Windows programs by using it.

 The Task Manager has a "Run new task" feature that lets you run WordPad without having to go to the Windows Start menu. When the Start menu isn't working or if you want to launch a program with different settings than the default, this is an option you might find helpful.

 The following steps will guide you through opening WordPad using the Task Manager:

2. On the top bar, click**Run new task** in the "Processes" tab.

4. Now click**OK** to launch the WordPad application.

## 5\. How to Open WordPad Using the Control Panel

 If you're a Windows user, you likely already know what the Control Panel is. This tool allows you to view and manipulate basic system settings, but it isn't just limited to that; you can also launch various applications by using it.

1. Press**Win + Q** on your keyboard and then type "Control Panel" into the search bar.
2. Select the Control Panel app that appears in the search results.
3. In the control panel, change the screen view to**Large icons** .
