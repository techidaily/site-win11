## 2\. Perform a Clean Boot

 You can [perform a clean boot](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/) to determine if a third-party app conflict is causing the copy-and-paste functionality to malfunction. Third-party app conflicts are among the common contributing factors to this problem.

 In clean boot mode, Windows starts with a minimal set of drivers. To do this, you will need to manually disable all the non-essential services and startup programs and restart your PC. To perform a clean boot:

1. Press **Win + R** to open **Run**.
2. Type **msconfig.msc** and click **OK** to open **System Configuration**. You can also search for system configuration in **Windows Search** and open the app.
3. In the **System Configuration** window, open the **Services** tab.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. Check the **Hide all Microsoft services** box. This will hide all the essential system services necessary to operate the system so that you donâ€™t accidentally disable them.
5. Click the **Disable All** button to disable third-party services.

1. Open the **Startup** tab and click **Open Task Manager.**
2. The Task Manager will open in the **Startup** tab.  
![Windows 11 Task Manager showing the Startup tab.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/disable-startup-apps-windows-11.jpg)

4. Once you have disabled all the startup apps, go back to the **System Configuration** dialog. Click **Apply** and **OK** to save the changes.
5. Click **Restart** to reboot your PC in clean boot mode.

 After the restart, see if you can successfully copy and paste. If the problem is fixed, it's safe to assume a third-party app caused it. To find the troublesome app, open Task Manager and start enabling startup apps one by one until you find the problematic app.

 If the issue persists in the clean boot mode, proceed with the next steps. Before that, enable all the disabled services in System Configuration.

 To disable the clean boot mode and start Windows normally, open the **System Configuration** utility, go to the **General** tab, then select the **normal startup** option.

## 7\. Check Your Keyboard for Hardware Issues

 If you have [remapped your keyboard keys on Windows,](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap-fix-keyboard-layout/) make sure the **Ctrl + C / Ctrl + V** shortcut is set correctly.

If it works, you are likely dealing with a faulty left Ctrl key.

## 7\. Check Your Keyboard for Hardware Issues

 If you have [remapped your keyboard keys on Windows,](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap-fix-keyboard-layout/) make sure the **Ctrl + C / Ctrl + V** shortcut is set correctly. Also, look for issues with the Ctrl keys. Your keyboard likely features multiple Ctrl keys. Try to use the additional Ctrl key at the bottom right of your keyboard to copy and paste. If it works, you are likely dealing with a faulty left Ctrl key. If there is a faulty key, there are ways to [fix broken keys on your computer keyboard](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-keyboard-keys/).
