## Begin Your Windows Journey with a Voice Guide

 Windows comes with a built-in application called Narrator that reads aloud text. It can read documents, emails, web pages, and other text that appears on the screen. The Narrator application is also useful for people with visual impairments who need assistance reading text on a screen.

 It has a number of features that make it easy to customize and user-friendly. This article will show you how to access this tool on Windows 11.

## 1\. How to Start the Narrator Using a Keyboard Shortcut

 If you're using Windows 11, you can open Narrator by pressing**Win + Ctrl + Enter** on your keyboard. This shortcut will work even if you're in another app or in the middle of a task.

 To stop the Narrator from reading aloud, press**Caps Lock + Esc** .

## 2\. How to Start the Narrator Using a Run Command

 The Run command on a Windows operating system is a quick way to open an application or document. If you're using a screen reader or text-to-speech software on your Windows 11 computer, you can open it using the Run command. Here's how:

1. Press**Win + R** on your keyboard. Doing so opens the Run dialog box.
2. In the Run window that opens, type "Narrator" into the field and click**OK** .

3. The narrator will now launch and begin reading aloud whatever is on your screen.

## 3\. How to Start the Narrator via Command Prompt

 Windows 11 comes with a built-in screen reader called Narrator that you can use if you need a screen reader. Here's how to open it via the Command Prompt:

1. Open the Run Command dialog box (see [how to open Run on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) for instructions).
2. Type "cmd" in the text box and press**Ctrl + Shift + Enter** .
3. If UAC appears on the screen, click**Yes** to continue.

5. The Narrator window will open, and you can start using the screen reader.

## 4\. How to Start the Narrator With the Windows Search Tool

 If you're using a screen reader because you have vision problems, you know how important it is to be able to find things quickly on your computer. The Windows Search tool can help you do just that.

1. To open the Windows Search tool, click the**Start** button.

2. Type "Narrator" into the search box and select the top result.

You now have Narrator running on your computer.

## 9\. How to Start Narrator Through Task Manager

## 11\. How to Pin Narrator to the Taskbar

2. Right-click on the search result and select**Pin to taskbar** from the context menu.
3. On your Taskbar tray, a new icon will appear. Click on this icon to launch Narrator.
