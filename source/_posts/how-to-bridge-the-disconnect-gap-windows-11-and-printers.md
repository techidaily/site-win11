## How to Bridge the Disconnect Gap: Windows 11 & Printers

 Windows supports a lot of printers by default, so you can start printing right after connecting it to your PC. However, even after installing the correct drivers, you may encounter a "Windows cannot connect to printer" error.

 This error can occur for a few reasons; perhaps you have not set up your printer correctly or the printer cables might be loose. Here are some troubleshooting methods if you cannot print from certain apps or connect your printer to Windows.

## 1\. Restart the Printer

 Issues with external devices such as your printer often occur due to miscommunications between the device and your computer, outdated drivers, or even minor software glitches.

 If you're experiencing trouble with your printer, your first defense should be to try restarting it. Restarting the printer is the best way to fix most of its connection issues.

 It's pretty simple to restart a printer by using the following steps:

1. Turn off your printer by pressing the **Power** button.
2. Once the printer's display turns off, you must remove the power cable from your printer.
3. Wait at least 20 seconds before reconnecting the power cable.
4. Now, you can order a test print from your Windows PC and check for connection issues.

 In most cases, a simple restart should fix any connection issues with your printer. However, if this doesn't get your job done, there are plenty of other ways.

## 2\. Check All the Connected Cables

![A Network Printer Back Side](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/A-Network-Printer-Cable.jpg)

 Turn off your printer and disconnect it from the power source. Now, make sure to check all the connected cables of your printer. If any cable is loose, you've got to connect it properly to avoid connection issues. Also, if the cables are damaged or cut, the only resort is replacing them.

 Before turning the power back on, ensure the cables are connected to the correct ports. If you're unsure about the ports, refer to your printer manufacturer's website or the manual provided with the printer itself. Finally, you can turn the power on and check for errors by printing a test document.

 Please ensure that the ports are clean and working properly. If your computer's ports are having issues, check our guide on [how to fix dead USB ports on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/dead-usb-port-heres-how-to-diagnose-and-fix-it/).

## 3\. Review the Group Policy Editor

 The Group Policy Editor (GPE) is an advanced configuration editor for the Windows OS. It lets you tweak most of the advanced Windows settings in no time.

 When you connect a printer to your computer without administrator rights, Windows doesn't allow you to install the drivers correctly. In such a case, you must modify an option in the Group Policy Editor to fix it.

 Follow the steps outlined below to resolve the connection issues with your printer using GPE:

1. Open the Run menu by pressing **Win + R** on your keyboard.
2. Now, type **gpedit.** **msc** and click **OK**.  
![Gpedit In Run Menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Gpedit-In-Run-Menu.jpg)
3. Under **Computer Configuration**, click **Administrative Templates > Printers**.
4. Double-click the **Limits print driver installation to Administrators** option and select **Disabled**.  
![Printer Related Option In GPE](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Printer-Related-Option-In-GPE.jpg)
5. To save the changes, click **Apply** and then **OK**.
6. Now you've to restart your PC.

 Also, ensure that the **Allow Print Spooler to accept client connections** option is set to either **Not Configured** or **Enabled**.

 The GPE feature is exclusive to the Windows Pro, Education, and Enterprise editions. Therefore, you must use a workaround to [access the Group Policy Editor on Windows Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/).

## 4\. Update Your Printer’s Driver

 Now that you've got the required permissions to install your printer drivers, head to your printer's manufacturer's website and download the necessary drivers.

 Suppose you've already installed the drivers and are still facing connection issues. In this case, you must update the printer's drivers. Follow the steps mentioned below to update your printer's driver:

1. Open the Start menu by pressing the **Windows** key and type **Device Manager**.  
![Device Manager In Start Menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Device-Manager-In-Start-Menu.jpg)
2. Click **Open** and select **Print queues** to check all the connected Printers.
3. Right-click on your printer name from the list.
4. From the context menu that follows, click **Update driver**.  
![Update Driver Option In Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Update-Driver-Option-In-Windows.jpg)
5. If you've downloaded the latest driver file, select **Browser my computer for drivers**. Then, you've to choose the driver file from Windows Explorer to update the driver.
6. If you don't have the driver file, click **Search automatically for drivers** to update your printer's driver.
7. Once done, restart your PC.

 If you're not a geek and want a one-click solution, you can use any of the [free driver updaters for Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-best-free-driver-updaters/). Before running a driver scan, you must connect the printer to your computer.

 If the pre-installed drivers are corrupted, it can cause printer issues. Thankfully, with every major update, Microsoft continuously adds support for more and more printers and their drivers. This is why we always recommend updating to the most recent Windows version.

## 5\. Run the Printer Troubleshooter

 Microsoft has provided a dedicated troubleshooter for fixing printer-related issues in Windows. So, if you're still unable to [resolve problems related to your printer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-printer-not-working/), running a printer troubleshooter might be helpful.

 Here are the steps you need to follow to run a printer troubleshooter:

1. Press **Win + I** to open the Settings app.
2. Click **System > Troubleshoot > Other troubleshooters** and click **Run** next to the **Printer** option. Once done, the troubleshooter will automatically show you the recommended fixes on the screen.

## 6\. Restart the Print Spooler Service

 If you've already performed all the above steps but are still struggling, restarting the print spooler service may help ease your headache.

 The Printer Spooler service in Windows helps the operating system recognize the connected printers. Thus, if the print spooler service is disabled, even by mistake, there's no way you can get your printer working.

 You can restart the spooler service using the steps given below:

1. Open the Run menu by pressing the **Win + R** key combination.
2. Once the menu appears, type **services.msc** and click **OK**.
3. Scroll down and find **Print Spooler** in the list.
4. Click the **Print Spooler** option and, on the left side of the screen, click **Restart**.  
![Print Spooler Service Menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Print-Spooler-Service-Menu.jpg)
5. That's it. Try to reconnect your printer to your computer.
