## Conquering Windows Control with Administrator Rights

 Have you ever wanted to run the Control Panel as an administrator on Windows? Doing so can give you access to certain configuration options that would otherwise be unavailable. This article will show you how to quickly and easily open the Control Panel with administrative privileges in any Windows version. Let's get started.

## 1\. How to open the Control Panel as an Administrator through Run Command

1. Right-click on Start and select**Run** or press**Win + I** on your keyboard. The Run dialog box will open.
