## Orchestrated Workflows: Joining IFTTT and To-Do

 Microsoft To Do is a handy personal task management tool. But have you ever tried automating it to boost your productivity even further? IFTTT—"If This Then That" is a no-code tool for task automation. Using IFTTT, you can automate task creation, completion, or cross-scheduling in Microsoft To Do.

 Ready to stop your daily manual rinse and repeat on Microsoft To Do? Here's how to go about it.

## Automating Email Notifications for New Microsoft To Do Tasks

 You'll use an IFTTT Applet to automate email notifications to designated email addresses whenever a task is created in Microsoft To Do. This Applet will use a chain of two Actions:

* The initial Action will create a new task whenever you add an event to Google Calendar.
* The second Action will send a task creation notification email to designated recipients.

 At least, you'll need an IFTTT Pro subscription of $2.5/month to add more than one Action to an Applet.

 Now let's go through a creative way to [use Microsoft To Do productively](https://www.makeuseof.com/productive-use-microsoft-to-do/). To begin, log into your IFTTT account or create an account on the [IFTTT website](https://ifttt.com/) if you've not already done so. You can also do this via the mobile app on Android or iOS. The steps are similar across platforms.

 Then follow these steps:

1. From your IFTTT dashboard, click **Create** at the top-right.  
![IFTTT dashboard](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ifttt-dashboard.jpg)
2. Click **Add** to the right of the **If This** banner.  
![If This Then That IFTTT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/if-this-then-that-ifttt.jpg)
3. Type "Google Calendar" in the search bar and click the **Google Calendar** banner once it appears.  
![Applet creation page IFTTT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/applet-creation-page-ifttt.jpg)
4. From the list of triggers, select **New event added**.  
![Trigger list in IFTTT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/trigger-list-in-ifttt-1.jpg)
5. If prompted, click **Connect** and follow the onscreen prompt to link your IFTTT account to your Google account.  
![Connection page IFTTT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/connection-page-ifttt.jpg)

1. Next, click **Create trigger**.  
![Trigger creation page IFTTT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/trigger-creation-page-ifttt.jpg)
2. Click the **Then That** banner. Next, type "To Do" in the search bar. Select **Microsoft To Do** when you see it.  
![New to do search IFTTT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/new-to-do-search-ifttt.jpg)
3. Click **Create task in task list**. IFTTT will add your Microsoft To Do account by default**.**  
![Trigger list to do add task to list](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/trigger-list-to-do-add-task-to-list.jpg)
4. You can click **Add new account** to switch Microsoft accounts.
5. From the **Which task list?** dropdown, select the task list that will receive the calendar trigger

1. The **Task body** field contains the ingredients included in the created task; this is the task description. The ingredients are highlighted in gray. You can leave this as default or remove what you don't want to include in your task details.  
![Task body IFTTT To Do Action](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/task-body-ifttt-to-do-action.jpg)
2. Click **Create action**.  
![IFTTT action final level scroll](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ifttt-action-final-level-scroll.jpg)
3. Next, click the cross icon (**+**) below the **Then** banner.  
![Applet creation for to do ifttt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/applet-creation-for-to-do-ifttt.jpg)

5. Select **Send an email**.  
![Trigger list for Gmail IFTTT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/trigger-list-for-gmail-ifttt.jpg)
6. Type the email addresses of the people you want to notify in the **To address** field. If tagging more than one email address, separate each with a comma. To tag more people, type their email addresses in the **CC** address and **BCC** address fields as required. These serve the [purpose of CC and BCC in regular emails](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-cc-bcc-mean-email/).  
![More action IFTTT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/more-action-ifttt.jpg)
7. Leave the other fields as they are. Then scroll down and click **Create** **action**.
8. Click **Continue.**
9. Finally, click **Finish** to activate your Applet.  
![Applet creation menu final](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/applet-creation-menu-final.jpg)

 The created Applet is now running on your IFTTT account. Whenever you add a Google Calendar event, it writes that task to your Microsoft To Do list and emails the listed addresses with the details of the task. This is a great [Google Calendar tip to boost productivity](https://www.makeuseof.com/google-calendar-tips-to-boost-productivity/).

## How to Use IFTTT for Task Replication in Microsoft To Do

 You can cross-schedule tasks from another task management app like Asana, Trello, or Clickup on Microsoft To Do.

 The Applet below will create a new task on Microsoft To Do whenever a new task is assigned to you from your organization on Asana:

1. Go to **Create** at the top-right and click the **If This** banner.  
![If This Then That IFTTT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/if-this-then-that-ifttt.jpg)
2. Type "Asana" in the search box and click **Asana**.

## How to Automate Task Completion Using IFTTT

 Using a different IFTTT Applet, you can automatically email people once you complete a task from the ones added to Microsoft To Do.

 You only need to ensure you track the same task list as done above in this new Applet. Here's how to go about it:

1. From your IFTTT dashboard, click **Create** and click the **If This** banner.
2. Next, type "To Do" in the search bar and select **Microsoft To Do** when you see it.
3. On the following page, click the **Task in list completed** trigger.  
![Microsoft To Do IFTTT trigger list](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/microsoft-to-do-ifttt-trigger-list.jpg)
4. Ensure you set the **Which task list?** dropdown to the task list used when automating task creation in the previous sections. For instance, if you're automating new task creation on "Example task," select this same task for the Trigger.  
![IFTTT trigger creation page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ifttt-trigger-creation-page.jpg)
5. Click the **Then That** banner and type "Gmail"in the search bar. Select **Gmail** when seen.  
![Service selection page for action IFTTT-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/service-selection-page-for-action-ifttt-1.jpg)
6. Click **Send an email**. Next, fill in the email address fields on the following page accordingly, separating the email addresses by a comma.  
 Depending on your workflow, these could also be the emails you notified when creating the task.
7. Leave the other fields as they are. Then click **Create action**.  
![Task creation page in IFTTT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/task-creation-page-in-ifttt.jpg)
8. Click **Continue**.  
![Applet creation page on IFTTT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/applet-creation-page-on-ifttt.jpg)

![IFTTT trigger creation page To Do task completion sample](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ifttt-trigger-creation-page-to-do-task-completion-sample.jpg)

 Whenever you complete the specified task in Microsoft To Do, your IFTTT Applet will send an email notification to the listed addresses that you've completed it.

 Besides these examples we've provided above, IFTTT also has public Microsoft To Do Applets you can use freely. Feel free to explore these on [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com/microsoft%5Ftodo)'s Microsoft To Do public Applets page.

## Automate Microsoft To Do Without Limitations

 IFTTT features over 700 services for automation. The only little limitation with it is that some triggers might be unsupported or not yet available. Despite this limitation, you can still link Applet units creatively to achieve your automation goal.
