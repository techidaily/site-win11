 Windows 11 comes with an improved clipboard that lets you copy multiple items to the clipboard and paste them as needed. However, the copy and paste function can stop working on your Windows 11 computer.

 This issue can occur because of corrupt system files or temporary glitches with Windows File Explorer. Here are a few troubleshooting steps to help you fix and restore the copy-and-paste functionality in Windows 11\.

## 1\. Clear Clipboard Data

 If conflicting data formats and corrupted data are causing the issue, [clearing your clipboard data](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-clear-clipboard-history/) can help. Doing so will delete your clipboard history, except for pinned items.

 To do this, press **Win+I** to open **Settings** and go to **System > Clipboard**. Click the **Clear** button next to **Clear clipboard data** to delete the history.

![Windows 11 Settings app showing the Clipboard settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/windows-11-settings-app-showing-the-clipboard-settings.png)

 If the issue persists, perform a quick restart to refresh hardware components and Windows services and apps to fix temporary glitches with your computer.

## 2\. Perform a Clean Boot

 You can [perform a clean boot](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/) to determine if a third-party app conflict is causing the copy-and-paste functionality to malfunction. Third-party app conflicts are among the common contributing factors to this problem.

 In clean boot mode, Windows starts with a minimal set of drivers. To do this, you will need to manually disable all the non-essential services and startup programs and restart your PC. To perform a clean boot:

1. Press **Win + R** to open **Run**.
2. Type **msconfig.msc** and click **OK** to open **System Configuration**. You can also search for system configuration in **Windows Search** and open the app.
3. In the **System Configuration** window, open the **Services** tab.

4. Once you have disabled all the startup apps, go back to the **System Configuration** dialog. Click **Apply** and **OK** to save the changes.
5. Click **Restart** to reboot your PC in clean boot mode.

 After the restart, see if you can successfully copy and paste. If the problem is fixed, it's safe to assume a third-party app caused it. To find the troublesome app, open Task Manager and start enabling startup apps one by one until you find the problematic app.

 If the issue persists in the clean boot mode, proceed with the next steps. Before that, enable all the disabled services in System Configuration.

 To disable the clean boot mode and start Windows normally, open the **System Configuration** utility, go to the **General** tab, then select the **normal startup** option.

![Windows 11 System Configuration dialog.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/normal-startup-windows-11-system-configuration.jpg)

 If you have [remapped your keyboard keys on Windows,](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap-fix-keyboard-layout/) make sure the **Ctrl + C / Ctrl + V** shortcut is set correctly.

 Once done, log in to your new local account and try to perform a copy-paste. If it works, you can [try to repair the previous account account](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/recover-lost-windows-10-user-profile/) or continue to use the new local account.

 Windows 11 comes with an improved clipboard that lets you copy multiple items to the clipboard and paste them as needed. However, the copy and paste function can stop working on your Windows 11 computer.

 This issue can occur because of corrupt system files or temporary glitches with Windows File Explorer. Here are a few troubleshooting steps to help you fix and restore the copy-and-paste functionality in Windows 11\.

## 1\. Clear Clipboard Data

 If conflicting data formats and corrupted data are causing the issue, [clearing your clipboard data](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-clear-clipboard-history/) can help. Doing so will delete your clipboard history, except for pinned items.

 To do this, press **Win+I** to open **Settings** and go to **System > Clipboard**. Click the **Clear** button next to **Clear clipboard data** to delete the history.

![Windows 11 Settings app showing the Clipboard settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/windows-11-settings-app-showing-the-clipboard-settings.png)

 If the issue persists, perform a quick restart to refresh hardware components and Windows services and apps to fix temporary glitches with your computer.

## 2\. Perform a Clean Boot

 You can [perform a clean boot](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/) to determine if a third-party app conflict is causing the copy-and-paste functionality to malfunction. Third-party app conflicts are among the common contributing factors to this problem.

 In clean boot mode, Windows starts with a minimal set of drivers. To do this, you will need to manually disable all the non-essential services and startup programs and restart your PC. To perform a clean boot:

1. Press **Win + R** to open **Run**.
2. Type **msconfig.msc** and click **OK** to open **System Configuration**. You can also search for system configuration in **Windows Search** and open the app.
3. In the **System Configuration** window, open the **Services** tab.

4. Check the **Hide all Microsoft services** box. This will hide all the essential system services necessary to operate the system so that you donâ€™t accidentally disable them.
5. Click the **Disable All** button to disable third-party services.

1. Open the **Startup** tab and click **Open Task Manager.**
2. The Task Manager will open in the **Startup** tab.  
![Windows 11 Task Manager showing the Startup tab.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/disable-startup-apps-windows-11.jpg)

4. Once you have disabled all the startup apps, go back to the **System Configuration** dialog. Click **Apply** and **OK** to save the changes.
5. Click **Restart** to reboot your PC in clean boot mode.

 After the restart, see if you can successfully copy and paste. If the problem is fixed, it's safe to assume a third-party app caused it. To find the troublesome app, open Task Manager and start enabling startup apps one by one until you find the problematic app.

 If the issue persists in the clean boot mode, proceed with the next steps. Before that, enable all the disabled services in System Configuration.

 To disable the clean boot mode and start Windows normally, open the **System Configuration** utility, go to the **General** tab, then select the **normal startup** option.

![Windows 11 System Configuration dialog.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/normal-startup-windows-11-system-configuration.jpg)
