## How To Activate a Black Background in WinCalc

 Dark Mode is a special screen setting design that changes the color scheme to display dark themes instead of light ones. It can be used to reduce eye strain and make the overall experience more pleasant while using an app.

 The Windows Calculator App is one such application that allows users to switch between light and dark modes according to their preferences. This tutorial explains how to enable Dark Mode in the Windows Calculator App.

## How to Enable Dark Mode in Windows Calculator App

 There are two ways to enable Dark Mode in the Windows Calculator App. The first method involves using the Calculator Settings, while the second uses Personalization Settings. Let's see each of them in detail:

### 1\. Using the Calculator Settings

 The Calculator App Settings provide an easy way to enable Dark Mode in the Windows Calculator App. This method is suitable for those who enjoy switching between light and dark modes without having to modify the Personalization Settings. To do it, follow these instructions.

 Open the Calculator app and click on the Navigation icon located in the top-left corner of the application. If you need help, see our guide on[how to open the built-in Calculator app on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-calculator/) .
