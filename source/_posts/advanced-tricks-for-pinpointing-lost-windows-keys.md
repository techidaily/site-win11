## What Is a Windows Product Key?

 A [Windows product key](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-product-keys-guide/) is a 25-character code you use to activate your copy of Windows. Since Windows 11 and 10 use a digital license method for activation, you don’t need to manually enter the key each time you upgrade or [clean install Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/important-things-remember-clean-installing-windows/).

 However, if you significantly change your device's hardware, Windows won't be able to detect the license tied to your device. A manual activation may also be necessary if you run into a Windows 11 activation error.

 To activate Windows in these cases, you'll need to enter the 25-character product key. As such, if you don't know your product key, we'll explain how to extract it from your Windows 11 or 10 system.

 Note that each edition of Windows uses its own unique product key. For example, if you have a license for the Windows 11/10 Home edition, you cannot use it to activate Windows Pro or other editions.

## 1\. How to Find Your Windows 11/10 Product Key Using the Command Prompt

![Command Prompt window running the wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/command-prompt-windows-11-product-key.png)

1. Press **Win + S** on your keyboard to openthe search field on the Start menu.
2. Type **cmd** and then click on **Run as administrator** from the search result.

`wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey`
4. Your original product key will be displayed on the screen. Copy and save the key in a safe location, such as your Dropbox or Google Drive account, for future use.

 Once your copy of Windows is activated, it's a good idea to [link your Windows product key to a Microsoft account](https://www.makeuseof.com/link-windows-product-key-microsoft-account/). Doing so will ease the activation process if you need to do it again.

Use keywords like "Windows license", "Windows product", and "Windows activation" to search for the confirmation mail that you received. Or check the **Orders** section of your account with that online retailer to find information on how to retrieve the key, or how the key was initially delivered.

 As another option, look for physical stickers on your computer with information related to your computer hardware and software configuration. These may also include the Windows product key or other necessary details to help you locate it.

 In Windows 10 and 11, Microsoft has streamlined the license activation process. Irrespective of how you got your license, once activated, the product key is tied to your system hardware. Whether you upgrade to the next version or clean install the OS, Windows should automatically detect and verify the ownership.
