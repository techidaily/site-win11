## How to Download Your Cortana Data on Windows

 Cortana, the free digital assistant from Microsoft, helps you carry out your searches, set up reminders, get weather and news updates, etc., right from your voice. To do these tasks well, Cortana keeps a log of your searches and other personalized data, such as your contacts and calendar details.

 While this is incontrovertibly a nightmare for the more privacy-obsessed of us, there's a small silver lining in that Microsoft lets you view, download, and even delete your collected Cortana data. While we'll stick with just the downloading part here, we'll also briefly touch on how you can use this data.
