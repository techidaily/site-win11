 Whether you’re using Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, adding images and other objects adds visual appeal to your document, spreadsheet, or presentation. Here's how to do it.

##  Inserting Images from Your Computer

 Office applications allow you to insert images stored on your computer’s hard drive. To do so, place the cursor in the location that you would like the image to appear and select the “Pictures” option, found in the “Insert” tab.

 In Word or Excel, this option can be found in the “Illustrations” group.

![Insert a Picture in Word or Excel](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Insert-a-Picture-in-Word-or-Excel.png) 

 In PowerPoint, it’s found in the “Images” group.

![Insert a Picture in PowerPoint](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Insert-a-Picture-in-PowerPoint.png) 

 File Explorer will open. Navigate to the location of the image file, select it, then select “Insert.”

##  Inserting Images from the Web

 If you don’t have the image you want to insert stored locally on your computer, you can pull one from the web directly from the Office app. To get started, in Word and Excel, click on the "Insert" tab, locate the “Illustrations” group, and select “Online Pictures."

![Online pictures in Word or Excel](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Online-pictures-in-Word-or-Excel.png) 

Word, Excel

 In PowerPoint, go to the "Images" group within the "Insert" tab. From there, select "Online pictures."

 Bing’s Image Search will appear in a separate window. Input the search terms in the search bar and select the image that you want to insert. Once selected, click “Insert."

##  Inserting Charts

 Charts are a good resource for displaying trends in data over a set period. If charts are what you’re looking for, you can find the option in the “Illustrations” group of the “Insert” tab in Word and PowerPoint.

 With one of the major purposes of Excel being to display data trends, Microsoft gave it a dedicated “Charts” section---along with a “Tours” and “Sparklines” section---for quicker access to the selection of charts available in Office.

 Once you select the “Screenshot” option, a drop-down menu will appear. It will display a snapshot of any window you currently have open on your computer.

 Sometimes a simple shape is all you need to illustrate a point. If a shape is what you’re looking for, select “Shapes" found in the “Insert” tab’s “Illustrations” group on Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

 If you want to [tweak a shape](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/the-drone-editors-playbook-a-comprehensive-guide-for-2024/) a little, you can do so by using its edit points. Alternatively, you can [draw and edit your own shape](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-seamlessly-screen-record-the-mi-11-user-manual/) if you can’t find the shape you’re looking for.
