## Master the Art of Adjusting Admin Settings on Windows 11

 When you initially configure a Windows computer with a Microsoft account, you will be asked to create an administrator name. This is the profile that grants access to make administrative changes on the device.

 But if you ever decide to alter this username, there are different options available for doing so. This tutorial will show you how to change the Microsoft account administrator name in Windows 11.

## 1\. How to Change the Administrator Name Through System Settings

1. Go to the**Accounts** section.
2. Move to the right pane and click**Your info** .
3. Under**Related settings** , click**Manage my accounts** . This will take you to the "Manage accounts" page.

## 3\. How to Change the Administrator Name Through Command Prompt

 If you prefer using the Command Prompt instead of the Settings app or Control Panel, you can also change your Microsoft account administrator name through it. This is a command line interpreter tool that allows you to control your Windows computer system with instructions.

 To change the Microsoft account administrator name through Command Prompt, follow these steps:

1. [Run the Command Prompt as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/) .
2. In the elevated command prompt, type the following command:  
`wmic useraccount where fullname='userame' rename 'newname'`

 In the above command, replace**username** with the current administrator name and**newname** with what you want to set as your new name. For example, if you want to change the administrator name from Paul to Michael, your command will look like this:

 **wmic useraccount where fullname='Paul' rename 'Michael'**

 Press**Enter** to apply the changes. Your Microsoft account administrator name has been successfully changed. You can now sign in with your new Microsoft account administrator.
