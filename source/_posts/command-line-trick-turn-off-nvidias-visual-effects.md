## Command Line Trick: Turn Off NVIDIA's Visual Effects

 Overlays are a pretty common feature nowadays. Almost every gaming application, game launcher, and graphics card software offer an overlay option. But not every gamer needs an overlay setting that pops up every time you launch a game.

 If you feel that you don't need the GeForce overlay or the features that it offers, you can disable it. We will list out all the possible methods to hide and disable the Nvidia GeForce overlay.

## Why Use the Nvidia GeForce Overlay?

 Nvidia GeForce overlay is a useful gaming utility. It offers many great features for avid gamers and streamers. Rather than installing separate software for each feature, gamers get all of them in one app. Check our detailed [guide on Nvidia GeForce Experience app](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/geforce-experience-use-si/) for more info.

Here are some of the features of Nvidia GeForce overlay offers:

1. Screen recording to store all the game clips from a session.
2. Instant Replay to record the last 20 minutes of gameplay at 60 FPS.
3. Live broadcast the gameplay to Twitch or YouTube.
4. Capture high-resolution in-game screenshots and upload them to Google Photos or Imgur.
5. Share gameplay with friends.
6. Monitor graphics card performance.

## Can You Turn Off the Nvidia GeForce Overlay?

 Yes. It is possible to turn off the Nvidia GeForce overlay. The app offers the option to completely disable the feature in the settings.

## Does the Nvidia GeForce Overlay Impact System Performance?

 The Nvidia GeForce Experience app does not consume a lot of system resources. The official system requirements include a two-core processor and a GTX 600 series GPU.

 However, if you have a low-end system and are running demanding games with little to no resources to spare, then the overlay can take up valuable processing power.

 If the FPS drops are minuscule, you can ignore them. Otherwise, disabling the overlay or removing the Nvidia GeForce Experience app can help squeeze a few more frames from your games.
