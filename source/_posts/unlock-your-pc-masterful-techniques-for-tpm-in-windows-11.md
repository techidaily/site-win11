* The TPM stores crucial information about drivers and applications installed on your computer. Therefore, you must reset the TPM before selling your computer to protect your privacy.
* Clearing the TPM can also help you troubleshoot problems related to security, encryption, and authentication.
* You should clear the TPM before clean installing a new operating system. This way, the OS can fully deploy its TPM-based functionalities like attestation.
