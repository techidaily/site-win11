## Enabling and Customizing Proxies in Windows 11

 If you're unsure whether you're connected to a proxy server or need to check your proxy settings for any other reason, you've come to the right place. Here, we'll explore different ways to find your proxy server settings on Windows 11\. We'll also see how to reset the WinHTTP proxy server.

## What Is a Proxy Server?

 A proxy server acts as a gateway between your computer and the internet. When you connect to a proxy server and send a request to a website, your system directs the request to the proxy server. This request could be anything like playing a video, downloading a file, or opening a webpage.

 Subsequently, your request is forwarded to the website and then routed back to your computer. Connecting to a proxy server can come in handy in various situations. Some of them are listed below:

* A proxy server hides your identity. This way, you can [browse the internet without revealing your identity](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-browse-web-anonymously/).
* You can connect to a proxy server to block traffic from a particular website.
* Proxy server regularly caches frequently accessed websites. This improves the browser's performance and allows it to load websites faster.
* Connecting to a proxy server can also come in handy when you want to access a website that is blocked in your country or region.

 There are mainly three examples of proxy servers: **Open proxies**, **Commercial proxies**, and **Residential proxies**. The open proxy servers are free to use, and you can find them online. However, they are not always secure, and the probability is very low that they will work.

 Commercial proxy servers charge a certain amount of money for their services, and they are more secure than open proxy servers.

 Lastly, [residential proxies](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-a-residential-proxy/) are hosted on computers and smartphones. They are the most secure and reliable example of proxy servers. You can use them for web scrapping, social media marketing, bypassing geo-blocking, or any other operation requiring high anonymity.

## How to Reset the WinHTTP Proxy Settings

 WinHTTP or Windows HTTP Services allows the desktop applications and Windows services to communicate with the HTTP server. However, there may be times when you need to reset the WinHTTP proxy.

 If you face connectivity issues when updating Windows or using Microsoft Store or other UWP apps, try resetting the WinHTTP proxy. Here are the methods to do that.

### 1\. Reset the WinHTTP Proxy Settings Using Command Prompt

 To reset the WinHTTP proxy using Command Prompt, launch Command Prompt as an administrator and execute the following command.

`netsh winhttp reset proxy`

![Direct access (no proxy server) message in Command Prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/direct-access-no-proxy-server.jpg)

 Once the command is successfully executed, you will see a message that says **Direct access (no proxy server)**.

1. Launch Internet Options as above and switch to the Connections tab.
2. Click the LAN settings button.
3. Check the **Automatically detect settings** box.
4. Uncheck the **Use a proxy server for your LAN (These settings will not apply to dial-up or the VPN connection)** box. Then, click **OK** to save the changes.
