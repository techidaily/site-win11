## Troubleshooting Unreachable MS SQL Server for Malwarebytes on Win 10/11

 Malwarebytes is one of the more highly rated antimalware software for Windows. So, it’s a pity when some users can’t utilize Malwarebytes because of an error message that says "unable to connect the Service." Some users have reported seeing that error message when they try to open Malwarebytes.

 Users who’ve purchased the premium version of Malwarebytes will be particularly annoyed by this issue. Are you also stumped by Malwarebytes’ "unable to connect" error? If you are, this is how you can fix the "unable to connect the service" error for MalwareBytes in Windows 10 and 11.

## 1\. Set Malwarebytes to Run as an Administrator

 First, try applying simpler potential solutions, such as running Malwarebytes as an administrator. This will at least ensure the software has full system permissions when you start it.

 Our guide for[always running apps as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/always-run-apps-administrator-windows/) explains how you can apply this potential fix.

2. Type**services.msc** in the**Open** box and select**OK** to launch Services.
3. Double-click**Malwarebytes Services** to access that service’s properties window.
