## Error Handling Strategies

 When compared to a password, using a PIN provides a faster login experience on Windows. At times, you may want to change the account PIN for various reasons.

 Both Windows 10 and 11 provide a couple of options for changing the account PIN. Let’s go over both methods one by one.

## How to Change the Account PIN Using the Settings App

 The Windows Settings app makes it simple to manage sign-in options on your computer. Here’s how you can use it to change your account PIN on Windows. Note that this method will only work if you know your current PIN.

1. Open the**Start menu** and click the**gear-shaped icon** to launch the Settings app.
2. Use the left sidebar to navigate to the**Accounts** tab.
3. Click on**Sign-in options** in the right pane.
4. Click**PIN (Windows Hello)** to expand it.
5. Click the**Change PIN** button.
6. In the Windows Security window that appears, enter your current PIN followed by your new PIN.
7. Click**OK** to save the changes.

## How to Change the Account PIN From the Sign-In Screen

 The steps for changing the account PIN from the sign-in screen vary depending on whether you’re using a Microsoft account or a Local account. Here are the steps for both.

## Effortlessly Change Your Windows Account PIN
