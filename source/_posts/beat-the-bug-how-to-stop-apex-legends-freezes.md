## 1\. Close Unnecessary Background Running Applications

![End task option in the Task Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/end-task-option-2.jpg)

 Looking at the taskbar, you might feel that your computer has no applications open, but there may be plenty running in the background. Google Chrome, Microsoft Teams, and your graphics card software are some of the many programs that start running as soon as you boot your computer.

 If there are plenty of such applications running in the background, then your system becomes prone to connectivity and crashing issues. The solution here is simple -- close as many background apps as possible before launching Apex Legends.

 To do this, open the Task Manager, right-click on all unnecessary background applications and choose**End Task** . You can also [stop these programs from launching on boot in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-disable-startup-programs/) .

## 2\. Is Your CPU Overclocked?

 Overclocking your CPU is one of the many things you can do to get a better gaming performance on your computer.[CPU overclocking](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/cpu-overclocking/) can do wonders, provided you offer good ventilation and cooling.

 However, overclocking doesn't have the same impact on all the games. In some, it can reap great results, but in others, it can be the main culprit behind serious issues like constant crashing.

 So, to fix Apex Legends' crashing issue, consider disabling CPU overclocking, which will reset your processor to its default settings.

## 3\. Change the EasyAntiCheat Priority

 EasyAntiCheat is an anti-cheat service that ensures your multiplayer game is free from hacking and cheating. But sometimes, this service can consider your computer background processes malicious and cause various issues, including a complete game crash.

 The solution, in this case, is to lower the priority of EasyAntiCheat while Apex Legends is running in the background. To do that, open the Task Manager and choose the**Details** option from the left sidebar. Then, locate and right-click on the EasyAntiCheat service. Click on**Set Priority** and then choose**Low** from the context menu.

 Next, switch to Apex Legends and check if you still experience the crash.

## 4\. Tweak the In-Game Settings

![Apex Legends Settings page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/apex-legends-settings.jpg)

 Apex Legends offers a plethora of graphics-related options that you can enable to enhance the look of the game. Some of these options are only compatible with high-spec devices.

 Somehow, if you manage to enable these options on a low-spec device, the game will become prone to crashing. So, if you have a low-end computer, ensure the game is running on low resolution, and all the optional features are disabled.

 Here are some changes you must make while playing Apex Legends on a low-end device:

* **Display Mode** \- Windowed
* **Resolution** \- native
* **V-Sync** \- Disabled
* **Anti-Aliasing** \- Disabled
* **Texture Streaming Budget** \- Low
* **Adaptive Supersampling** \- Disabled
* **Ambient Occlusion Quality** \- Low
* **Sun Shadow Coverage and Detail** \- Low
* **Volumetric Lighting** \- Disabled
* **Dynamic Spot Shadows** \- Disabled
* **Effect Details** \- Medium
* **Impact Marks** \- Low
* **Ragdolls** \- Medium

 These settings work well on most low-end devices. Still, you can play around with these settings till you get the best combination for your computer.

## 5\. Check the Apex Legends Files for Corruption

 Apex Legends will likely crash on your computer if its files are corrupted. To detect and remove corruption, you'll have to verify the integrity of game files.

Here's how to do it in the EA app:

1. Launch the EA app and choose**My Collection** from the left sidebar.
2. Click the**three dots** on Apex Legends and choose**Repair.**
