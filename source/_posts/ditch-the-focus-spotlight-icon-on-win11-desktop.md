## Ditch the Focus: Spotlight Icon on Win11 Desktop

 Spotlight is a feature that adds different Bing images to Windows 11’s desktop background when enabled. That feature also adds a "Learn about this picture" icon to the desktop you can double-click to bring up image info. Right-clicking that icon brings up a context menu that includes a **Switch to next picture** option.

 The context menu doesn’t currently have an option for deleting the "Learn about this picture" icon. Maybe Microsoft might add such an option in a future version of Windows 11\. However, you can remove the Spotlight wallpaper icon from the desktop without a delete option with the methods below.
