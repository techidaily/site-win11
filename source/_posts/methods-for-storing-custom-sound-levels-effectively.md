 This will launch the troubleshooter and start scanning for any issues. Follow the on-screen instructions to fix any problems it finds. Once it's done, restart your computer and check if it solves the issue.

## 2\. Update or Reinstall Your Audio Driver

 Outdated or corrupted audio drivers can lead to various sound problems, including this one. So, if the audio troubleshooter doesn't find any issues, the next step is to update your audio drivers. Here's how to do it:

1. Right-click on Start and select**Device Manager** .
2. In the Device Manager window, expand the**Sound, video and game controllers** category.

3. Right-click on your audio device and select**Update driver** .
4. When Windows asks how you want to search for drivers, select**Search automatically for drivers** .

 Windows will then start searching for updated drivers and install them automatically. Follow any onscreen instructions if needed. Once the installation process is finished, restart your computer and see if this solved your problem.

 If not, you may need to reinstall your audio drivers. To do this, open Device Manager again. Right-click on your audio device and select**Uninstall device** .

 After uninstalling it, restart your computer. Windows will automatically detect your audio device and install the necessary drivers.

## 3\. Allow Applications to Take Exclusive Control

 If updating or reinstalling the driver didn't solve the issue, you may need to allow certain applications to take exclusive control of the audio device. Here's how to do it:

 To get started, launch Volume Mixer on your computer. If you need help, see our guide on[how to open Volume Mixer on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/open-volume-mixer-windows-11/) .

 In the Volume Mixer window, click on the**Speaker** icon to open the Properties window. Switch to the**Advanced** tab, and you'll see the**Exclusive Mode** section here.

![Allow Applications to Take Exclusive Control](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/allow-applications-to-take-exclusive-control.jpg)

 Check both boxes next to **Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device** and**Give exclusive mode applications priority** .

 Click**Apply** \>**OK** to save the changes. Now try adjusting the volume again and check if this fixes the issue.

## 4\. Create a New User Account

 If you're still unable to save settings in Windows Volume Mixer, you may need to[create a new Windows user account](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-local-user-account/) . This process won't delete your old profile or data, but you'll need to reconfigure your settings. Once created, log out of your current account and log into the new one to see if the settings reset issue is resolved.
