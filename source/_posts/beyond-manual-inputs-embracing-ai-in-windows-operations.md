## 3\. Automated Updates

 AI has introduced several quality-of-life features to Windows users. One such feature is automated updates, which use machine learning to help Windows users keep up with the latest software updates and security patches.

 Traditionally, updating Windows software is a manual process that requires users to download and install updates themselves, which is time-consuming and lead to security vulnerabilities. With automated updates, AI algorithms can detect the latest software patches, download, and install them without user intervention.

 Fortunately, Microsoft still lets you [update Windows manually](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-manually/) if need be, so the option isn't totally gone. However, Windows does do a good job automating the update process.

 AI algorithms can also analyze usage patterns and system performance data to identify potential issues that could impact software stability or security. By analyzing this data, AI can recommend updates that can improve the performance or stability of a user's system.

## 4\. Predictive Text and Autocorrect

![person typing on keyboard](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/person_typing_on_keyboard.jpg)

 Predictive text uses machine learning to analyze typed words and phrases and suggests the most likely next word or phrase based on the context of the text. These text prediction functions save users time and improve their typing accuracy, especially on Windows PCs.

 On the other hand, autocorrect uses algorithms to identify and correct spelling and grammatical errors as users type. This is especially helpful for people who struggle with spelling or typing accuracy, and for non-native speakers who are unfamiliar with the language’s nuances.

 Predictive text and autocorrect rely on AI and machine learning to analyze vast amounts of data and make predictions based on that data. As these algorithms continue to improve and become more accurate, we can expect to see even more sophisticated versions of these tools in our Windows software.
