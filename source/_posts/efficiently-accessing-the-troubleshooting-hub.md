## 1\. Open Startup Repair Using the Settings App

 This is the easiest way to go about launching the Startup Repair tool on Windows. So we will lay out this method first.

### How to Use the Windows 11 Settings App

 And that’s it. As soon as you click on the above option, the Startup Repair tool will be launched right then and there.
