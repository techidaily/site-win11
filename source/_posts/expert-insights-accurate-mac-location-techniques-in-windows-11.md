## Expert Insights: Accurate MAC Location Techniques in Windows 11

 Every device that connects to the internet has a Media Access Control (MAC) address that uniquely identifies it online. Your Windows PC, smartphone, tablet, and smartwatch have a unique MAC address that allows it to communicate with other devices over the internet.

 The 12-character alphanumeric MAC address is defined within the network adapter of your device by the manufacturer. It is typically used to set up network routing protocols or send data across a network. You might also need it to customize your network.

 So, how do you find your Windows 11's MAC address? Read on to find out.

## 1\. Find Your Windows 11 PC's Wifi or Ethernet MAC Address From the Settings App

 The**Settings** app in Windows 11 is a massive upgrade in terms of usability and makes it easy to find a specific setting quickly. Here's how you can find your device’s MAC address via the Windows 11 Settings app:

1. Launch the**Start** menu, search for the**Settings** app, and select the Best match.
2. From the sidebar, choose**Network & internet** , and then select**Wi-Fi** or**Ethernet** from the network page.
3. Finally, select**Hardware properties** , and you will see the details of your network configuration.

3. In the Windows IP Configuration, under the**Ethernet adapter** section, you can see your MAC address next to the**Physical Address** field.

## Can I Change the MAC Address on Windows 11?

 While it is possible to change the default MAC address of your Windows PC, device manufacturers strongly recommend against it as it can cause unexpected issues. Nevertheless, if you still want to change the MAC address of your device, make sure you’re aware of the possible implications before you get started.
