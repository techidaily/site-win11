## Navigating Network Nooks for Mac Address in Windows 11

 Every device that connects to the internet has a Media Access Control (MAC) address that uniquely identifies it online. Your Windows PC, smartphone, tablet, and smartwatch have a unique MAC address that allows it to communicate with other devices over the internet.

 The 12-character alphanumeric MAC address is defined within the network adapter of your device by the manufacturer. It is typically used to set up network routing protocols or send data across a network. You might also need it to customize your network.

 So, how do you find your Windows 11's MAC address? Read on to find out.

## 1\. Find Your Windows 11 PC's Wifi or Ethernet MAC Address From the Settings App

 The**Settings** app in Windows 11 is a massive upgrade in terms of usability and makes it easy to find a specific setting quickly. Here's how you can find your device’s MAC address via the Windows 11 Settings app:

1. Launch the**Start** menu, search for the**Settings** app, and select the Best match.
2. From the sidebar, choose**Network & internet** , and then select**Wi-Fi** or**Ethernet** from the network page.
3. Finally, select**Hardware properties** , and you will see the details of your network configuration.
