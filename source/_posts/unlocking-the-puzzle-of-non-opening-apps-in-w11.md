## Unlocking the Puzzle of Non-Opening Apps in W11

 The Mail and Calendar app ensures you stay up to date on your email and remain connected with the people that matter the most. However, for several reasons, it can sometimes become inaccessible.

 If this happens to you, check out these effective solutions to get Mail and Calendar back on track.

## Why Is the Mail and Calendar App Not Opening on Windows 11?

 One of the primary reasons the Mail and Calendar app is inaccessible on Windows 11 is the corrupt system files. The issue can also occur due to outdated Windows versions and temporary app glitches.

 Fortunately, it's very easy to troubleshoot the problem. Below are all the working fixes you can try in the situation.

## 1\. Restart and Install Updates

 The best thing you can try to eliminate any Windows issue is to restart the computer. If the problem is caused due to a temporary Windows glitch, it will be fixed with a simple restart.

 Additionally, you should ensure that you are running the latest Windows version. Sometimes outdated Windows is often the primary reason behind the inaccessibility of applications. You can download the latest Windows update by following the below steps.

1. Press**Win + I** to open**Settings** .
2. Click on**Windows Update** .
3. Click on**Check for updates** .  
![Windows Check for update screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Check-for-updates.jpg)
4. Windows will check for any pending updates and install them if available.

 After updating to the latest OS version, check if you can open the app. If not, move on to the next solutions.

## 2\. Download the Latest Updates for Mail and Calendar

 Similar to Windows' own updates, an outdated Mail and Calendar app can also cause issues. Try updating the app to see if that fixes your problem.

Here's how to update Mail and Calendar on Windows 11.

1. Open the Start Menu, type**Microsoft Store** , and press Enter.
2. Click on**Library** at the bottom left corner.
3. Click on**Get updates** .  
![Microsoft Store app library](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Get-updates.jpg)
4. Microsoft Store will suggest updates for all the installed UWP apps.
5. Download the update available for Mail and Calendar.

 After updating the application, reboot the system and check for the issue.

## 3\. Run the Windows Store Apps Troubleshooter

 The Windows Store app troubleshooter is a built-in utility that solves issues revolving around UWP apps. It is the go-to option whenever a UWP app becomes inaccessible or crashes randomly.

Here's how to run the Windows Store Apps Troubleshooter.

1. Open Settings.
2. Choose**Troubleshoot** under the**System** tab.
3. Click on**Other troubleshooters** .
4. Click on**Run** next to Windows Store Apps.

5. The troubleshooting window will pop up and look for the problem.

 If any problem is found, follow the onscreen instructions to apply the potential fixes.

## 4\. Check Mail Sync Settings

 Another quick way to fix the Mail and Calendar app not opening issue is to customize the mailbox sync settings. As it turns out, if the app is not synced with your account, you might face issues opening it or receiving new emails.

 The solution is to ensure your account is in sync with the app. Here's how to do that:

1. Open the Settings app and choose**Accounts** from the left sidebar.
2. Choose the**Email & accounts** option under the**Account** **settings** .  
![Email & accounts option in the Settings app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/email-accounts.jpg)
3. Click the drop-down icon next to your email account and choose**Manage** from the menu that crops up.  
![Manage option in the Settings app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/manage-option.jpg)
4. Choose the**Change mailbox sync settings** option.
5. Click the drop-down icon under**Download new content** and choose**as items arrive** option.
6. Enable the toggle under the**Email, Calendar** and**Contacts** options.

7. Click**Done** to save the changes.

## 5\. Change Mail and Calendar Privacy Settings

 You're likely to face the issue due to misconfigured privacy settings of the Mail and Calendar app. To fix this, follow these steps:

1. In the Settings app, choose**Privacy & security** from the left sidebar.
2. Under the**App permissions** section, click on the**Calendar** option.  
![Calendar option in Privacy & security window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/calendar-option.jpg)
3. Enable the toggle next to**Mail and Calendar** .  
![Mail and Calendar toggle in Calendar window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/mail-and-calendar-toggle.jpg)
4. Next, click on the**Email** option in the App permission section, and enable the toggle next to**Mail and Calendar** in the following window.

## 6\. Repair the Mail and Calendar App

 Repairing the app is a textbook trick that is often recommended to troubleshoot any minor issue. We recommend trying this to fix the Mail and Calendar app as well.

Here are the steps to repair the Mail and Calendar app.

1. [Open Settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) by using Win + I hotkeys.
2. Click on**Apps** from the left pane.
3. Choose**Apps & features** .

![Mail and Calendar repair and reset screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Repair-Mail.jpg)

 Windows will take a few seconds to repair the app. Once the process is complete, launch the Mail and Calendar, and check if you are still facing the problem.

## 7\. Clear Microsoft Store Cache

 A corrupt Microsoft Store cache is another cause of a malfunctioning Mail and Calendar app. As such, try clearing the Microsoft Store cache data and see if it fixes the issue.

Here's how to do it.

1. Open**Command Prompt** in administrator mode.
2. Type**wsreset.exe** and press Enter.

 Command Prompt will take a few seconds to execute the command. After that, the Microsoft Store will open automatically.

## 8\. Whitelist Mail and Calendar on Windows Defender Firewall

 Windows Defender Firewall is a built-in Windows tool that makes sure that your system is free from viruses and malware. But at the same time, if Mail and Calendar is blocked under the Firewall settings, you will fail to access the app. You'll have to allow Mail and Calendar through the Firewall to fix the problem.

Here's how to do it.

1. Open Start Menu, type**Windows Security** , and press Enter.
2. Click on**Firewall & network protection** on the left pane.
3. Choose**Allow an app through the firewall** .
4. Click on**Change settings** .
5. Locate Mail and Calendar.
6. Check both the**Private** and**Public** options for Mail and Calendar.  
![Windows Firewall allow an app through firewall screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Mail-and-Calendar.jpg)
7. Click OK to save the changes.

 The third-party antivirus program can also cause the issue. Try to disable it and check if you can access the Mail and Calendar app.

## 9\. Re-Register the Mail And Calendar App

 Re-registering the Mail and Calendar app is another solution you can try in this situation. This method solves issues that lead to inaccessibility and sudden application crashes.

Here's how to register the Mail and Calendar app.

1. [Open the Windows PowerShell](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-command-prompt-powershell/) window by clicking on**Start** and typing "windows powershell" in the search bar.
2. Type the following command and press Enter.  
`Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register &ldquo;$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml&rdquo;}`

 Wait until the command is executed. After that, reboot the system, and check for the problem.

## 10\. Remove Corruption From Your Computer

 The problem can occur due to corrupt system files as well. You can eliminate the issue by running a System File Checker, aka SFC scan.

Here are the steps to run an SFC scan.

1. Open**Command Prompt** in Administrator mode by opening the**Start** menu, typing "command prompt,", right-clicking the search result, and selecting**Run as Administrator.**
2. Type**sfc /scannow** and press Enter.

 Now, check if the problem continues. If yes, try running the DISM scan.

 DISM scans the system for inconsistencies that may result from application failure. You can run DISM by going through the steps below.

1. Open Command Prompt in administrator mode.
2. Type the following command and press Enter.  
`DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth`

Reboot the system once DISM finishes.

## 11\. Reinstall Mail and Calendar

 If none of the fixes helped solve the issue, you could consider reinstalling the Mail and Calendar app. You can reinstall Mail and Calendar by following the below steps.

1. Open PowerShell in administrator mode.
2. Type the following command and press Enter. It will uninstall the Mail and Calendar app.  
`Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps | Remove-AppxPackage`

 Next, open the Microsoft Store, and download the Mail and Calendar app.

## Open Mail And Calendar With Ease

 It is pretty hard to pinpoint the exact reason behind the problem; thus, you might have to go through all the solutions to make the Mail and Calendar app accessible again. But if none of the solutions was helpful, you can consider using a third-party application.
