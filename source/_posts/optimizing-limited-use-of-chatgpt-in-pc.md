## Optimizing Limited Use of ChatGPT in PC

 While ChatGPT works fine most of the time, sometimes you'll come across an error. The most common one you might see is the "ChatGPT is at capacity right now" error.

 Encountering this error can be frustrating, especially if you see it every time you try to log in to the platform. So, let's check out what causes the "ChatGPT is at capacity right now" error and how to fix it on Windows

## What Causes the "ChatGPT Is at Capacity Right Now" Error?

 The capacity error is a real pain, and it can stop your conversation with the chatbot. Oftentimes, the error appears when ChatGPT servers are overloaded. But corrupt browser data, malicious extensions, active proxy servers, and outdated network drivers can also be the culprits behind the issue.

 Fortunately, you can quickly troubleshoot this ChatGPT error by applying the below fixes.

## 1\. Take a Break From ChatGPT

 As aforementioned, there's a good chance that ChatGPT's servers are overloaded. This happens when the traffic is more than the servers can handle, and ChatGPT doesn't have any room to accept any more people right now.

 The best thing to do in this situation is to try ChatGPT after some time. If the problem persists, it might be a sign of something wrong on your end.

## 2\. Check the ChatGPT Server Status

 The capacity error can also appear if the ChatGPT servers are under maintenance. To confirm this, open[DownDetector](https://downdetector.com/) on your browser, type**"OpenAI"** in the search bar, and click the**Search icon.**

 If there's a major increase in reported issues, it's likely a server problem. You can't do much in this case other than wait for OpenAI to resolve it.

 However, if DownDetector reports indicate that ChatGPT servers are stable, then there's likely corruption in your browser's cache data that's causing the issue.

## 3\. Clear Your Browser's Cache Data

 Another effective way to fix the "ChatGPT is at capacity right now" error is to clear your browser's cache data. If you use Google Chrome, here's how to clear its cache data:

1. Launch Google Chrome, click the**three-vertical dots** at the top-right corner, and choose**Settings** from the context menu.
2. Choose**Privacy and security** from the left sidebar.
3. Select**Clear browsing data.**
4. Check**Cookies and other site data** , and**Cache images and files** box, and then click the**Clear data** option.

 After clearing the cache, restart Google Chrome and check for the issue.

 If you use a different browser, check out[how to clear the cache on Microsoft Edge](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clear-microsoft-edge-cache-browsing-data/) and[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.makeuseof.com/clear-cache-firefox/) .

## 4\. Disable All Browser Extensions and Remove Any Problematic Ones

 Browsers offer a plethora of extensions to improve your productivity. But some extensions can interfere with the browser and cause various issues, including one at hand.

 You'll have to detect and remove such problematic extensions from your browser. Here's how to do that on Google Chrome:

1. Open**Chrome** \> click the**three-vertical dots** \>**More tools** \>**Extensions** .
2. Disable all the extensions.

 Now, start enabling each extension one by one until the error appears again. After recognizing the problematic extension, click the**Remove** button on its tablet.

![Remove Option for removing extensions on Chrome](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/remove-option.jpg)

 If you use a different browser, check out[how to easily disable or remove your browser extensions](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-clean-up-your-browser-extensions-the-easy-way/) to detect and remove the problematic extension from Firefox, Edge, and other browsers.

## 5\. Turn Off Any Active VPN Connections

 Using VPN can help you access websites that are banned in your area. But, on the negative side, a VPN can slow down your connection and make it unstable.

 So, if you are using a VPN, consider turning it off. After that, access ChatGPT and see if you still face the error.

## 6\. Try Incognito Mode

![Incognito mode of Chrome](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/incognito-mode.jpg)

 Another quick method to fix the error is to switch to incognito mode. In this mode, your browser makes a temporary session that is isolated from its main session and your data.

 To switch to incognito mode on Chrome and Edge, press the**Ctrl + SHIFT + N** hotkeys after launching the browser. And to access incognito mode on Firefox, open it and press the**Ctrl + SHIFT + P** hotkeys.

## 7\. Update Your Network Driver

 Outdated or corrupt network drivers can cause various network issues, including this capacity error. So, download any available network driver update and check if it makes any difference. Here's how:

1. Press the**Win + X** hotkeys to open the**Power User Menu.**
2. Choose**Device Manager** from the list.
3. Double-click on the**Network adapters** node to expand it.
4. Right-click on the installed network adapter and choose**Update driver.**  
![Network update driver option of Device Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/network-update-driver-option.jpg)
5. Choose**Search automatically for drivers** option.

 Windows will search for and download any available network driver update on your computer.

 If Windows fails to find anything, try looking online for a driver instead. Take note of the name of your network adapter, then search for it on a search engine alongside the word "driver." Try to download the driver from the official manufacturer's website, if you can.

## 8\. Reset Your Network Settings

 If updating the network driver wasn't helpful, try resetting your network settings. This fix will be especially helpful to users for whom the problem is caused due to misconfigured network settings. Resetting the network will restore all the network settings to their default values.

Here's how to reset the network settings on Windows 11:

1. Press the**Win + I** hotkeys to open the**Settings app.**
2. Choose**Network & internet** from the left sidebar.
3. Select the**Advanced network settings** option in the right pane.
4. Under the More settings section, choose the**Network reset** option.
5. Click the**Reset now** button next to**Network reset.**

6. If UAC crops up, click Yes to confirm your selection.

## 9\. Try a Different Browser

 Sometimes, your browser itself might be the culprit behind the "ChatGPT is at capacity right now" error. If you've tried all the above solutions but nothing worked, consider switching to a different browser.

## 10\. Report the Issue to OpenAI

Choose**Messages** from the window that crops up. After that, click the**Send us a message** button, and select your issue.
