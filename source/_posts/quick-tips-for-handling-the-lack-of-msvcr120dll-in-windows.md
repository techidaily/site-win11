## Quick Tips for Handling the Lack of MSVCR120.DLL in Windows

 Do you keep getting an error that reads “The program can’t start because MSVCR120.dll is missing from your computer” while opening apps or programs on Windows? This can happen due to a variety of reasons, including a damaged Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable package, corrupt system files, malware infection, and more.

 Whatever the cause, fixing the msvcr120.dll missing error on Windows isn’t too difficult. Here are the solutions you need to try.

## 1\. Repair the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable

 The msvcr120.dll file is a component of the Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable package. If there are any issues with this package, it may lead to the msvcr120.dll missing error on Windows. You can try repairing the Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable package on your PC to see if that fixes the error. Here are the steps for the same.

1. Click the **magnifying icon** on the taskbar or press the **Win + S** keyboard shortcut to access the search menu.
2. Type **control panel** in the search box and select the first result that appears.
3. Use the drop-down menu in the top right corner to change the view type to **Small icons** or **Large icons**.
4. Click on **Programs and Features**.

## 2\. Reinstall Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable

 If updating the Visual C++ Redistributable package does not help, you can try reinstalling it on your PC. To do so, use these steps:

1. Open up any web browser and visit Microsoft’s website to [download the Visual C++ Redistributable packages](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ph/download/details.aspx?id=40784).
2. Select your preferred language using the drop-down menu and click the **Download** button.
3. Tick the **vcredist\_x64.exe** and **vcredist\_x86.exe** checkboxes and click **Next**.  
![Download the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable.png](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/download-the-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-png.jpg)

 Double-click the downloaded setup file and follow the on-screen prompts to finish the installation process. After that, check if the error occurs again.

 If you are using 64-bit Windows, you can install both vcredist\_x64.exe and vcredist\_x86.exe. However, if you have a 32-bit version of Windows, you should only install vcredist\_x86.exe. You can [tell if the Windows version you are using is 32-bit or 64-bit](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-easy-ways-to-know-if-youre-on-a-64-bit-version-of-windows/) by checking the system information.

## 3\. Copy the Msvcr120.dll From Another Computer

 While troubleshooting the msvcr120.dll missing error, you might stumble upon websites that promise to fix the error through a quick download of the DLL file. However, doing so can be risky, as the file may be infected by malware.

 A safer alternative is to manually copy the msvcr120.dll file from another computer and paste it into the appropriate folder on your computer. You can transfer the msvcr120.dll file from another computer [using nearby sharing on WIndows](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-nearby-sharing-on-windows-11/) or an external storage device.

 Once you get the msvcr120.dll file, you can paste it into the appropriate folder. If you are using the 64-bit version, you should paste it into **Local Disk (C:) > Windows > System32**. For the 32-bit version, you should paste it into **Local Disk (C:) > Windows > SysWOW64**.

## 4\. Update or Reinstall the Problematic Program

 If you encounter the msvcr120.dll missing error only when launching a specific app or program, it is likely that the program is unable to access the DLL file. You can try updating the problematic program to its most recent version to see if that helps.

 If the error persists even after that, you can consider removing the program completely and installing it again. We have a detailed guide on [different ways to uninstall software on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/). You can follow any one of the methods outlined there to uninstall the problematic program. Make sure you [eradicate leftovers from the uninstalled program](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-remove-leftovers-uninstalled-software/) before reinstalling it on your PC.

## 5\. Re-Register the Msvcr120.dll File

 Re-registering the MSVCR120.dll file on your system refreshes the registration information for the file in the Windows Registry. This can help resolve issues caused by missing or corrupted registry entries that may have led to the error.

 To re-register the msvcr120.dll file on Windows, use these steps:

1. Right-click on the **Start icon** and select **Terminal (Admin)** from the list.
2. Select **Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
