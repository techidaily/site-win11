## 3\. Create a New Folder With a Keyboard Shortcut

 If you prefer to work with the keyboard rather than a mouse, or if you simply want to create a new folder faster, you can use the**Ctrl + Shift + N** keyboard shortcut on Windows.

 Simply head to the location where you want to create the folder and press**Ctrl + Shift + N** together on your keyboard. Once the folder is created, you can rename it to anything you want.

 Another way to create folders on Windows is via a command-line utility. While it may not be as quick as the other methods mentioned above, it can certainly come in handy if you need to [create multiple folders at once](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-11-create-multiple-folders/) .

 You can use Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell to create new folders on Windows. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Use the**Win + S** keyboard shortcut to open Windows Search.
2. Type**Command Prompt** or**PowerShell** in the search box and select**Run as administrator** .
3. Select**Yes** when the [User Account Control (UAC) prompt](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-disable-user-account-control-prompt/) appears.
4. In the console, type the following command and press**Enter** to navigate to the location where you want to create a new folder. Make sure you replace**Directory** in the following command with the actual directory location where you want to create the folder.  
`cd Directory`
5. Next, type**mkdir** followed by the name of the folder you wish to create and press**Enter** . For instance, if you were to create a folder named**Work** , you'd type the following command:  
`mkdir Work`
