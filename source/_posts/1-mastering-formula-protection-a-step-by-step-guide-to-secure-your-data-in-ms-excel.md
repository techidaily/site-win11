##  How Do You Lock the Cells Containing Formulas in Excel?

 By default, when you [protect your worksheet](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-essential-tips-for-gameplay-screen-captures-on-xbox-one-for-2024/), Excel locks all the cells in your sheet and not just the ones containing formulas. To get around that, you'll have to first unlock all your cells, select the cells containing formulas, and then lock these cells with formulas.

 This way, users can edit the values of all cells in your worksheet except for the ones that have formulas in them.

 In the "Review" tab, click the "Protect Sheet" option.

![Select "Protect Sheet."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/7-protect-excel-sheet.png)
