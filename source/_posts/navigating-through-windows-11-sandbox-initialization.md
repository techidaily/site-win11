## Navigating Through Windows 11 Sandbox Initialization

 Microsoft Windows 11 features multiple virtualization solutions out of the box. While Hyper-V is an excellent tool, Windows Sandbox is an easy alternative to Windows virtual machines. It lets you run untrusted apps in an isolated environment without the hassle of setting up a complete virtualization tool.

 Unfortunately, Windows Sandbox is not available on the Home edition of the OS. If you are running the Pro, Enterprise, and Education edition, here is how to enable and set up Windows Sandbox in Windows 11.

## How to Set Up Windows Sandbox in Windows 11

 Windows Sandbox is an optional feature, which means you'll have to install it from the Optional features section. You can [add and remove optional features from the Windows Features dialog](http://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-add-remove-optional-features-windows-11/) . Alternatively, you can use PowerShell or Command Prompt for a swift installation of Windows Sandbox.

 While the setup process is easier, your computer must meet some system requirements. Windows 11 Pro, Education, or Enterprise running computers with virtualization support are Windows Sandbox compatible. In most cases,[if your system can run Windows Hyper-V](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-enable-hyper-v/) , it should also run Windows Sandbox.

 Now that you have Windows Sandbox installed, you can start using it to test untrusted apps in isolation. To launch the app, press**Win + S** to open**Windows Search** and type**Windows Sandbox.** Click on the app from the search result to open it.

 Upon its launch, Windows Sandbox looks like a lightweight version of your Windows machine. You can copy files from your host system or download them from the Internet using the built-in web browser. Any actions you perform in the sandbox will not affect your host system.

 Once the testing is complete, close the Sandbox and click**OK** to confirm the action. Unlike a VM, Sandbox will delete all the data (including apps and files) upon exit. So, you'll get a clean, isolated environment running the same Windows OS build as your host machine each time.

## Set Up and Use Windows Sandbox in Windows 11

 Windows Sandbox provides an excellent way to test apps and files in an isolated environment without the hassle of setting up a virtual machine. While the virtual machines have distinct advantages, Sandbox is lighter, faster, and loads a fresh copy of Windows OS each time it's run.

 Windows 11 Home users, however, have missed out on this excellent feature. But if you must use a sandbox, consider using third-party alternatives such as Sandboxie Plus and SHADE Sandbox. These alternatives offer a similar set of functionalities with no complicated setup involved.
