## Hide the Task View Button Using the Registry Editor

 The Registry Editor allows you to modify different registries of your computer. You can use this tool to access the Task View registry and configure it to be hidden from the taskbar. ​​​​​​

 Editing the registry is risky, as one wrong edit can make your system unstable. Therefore, make sure to [back up the registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) and [create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) before proceeding with the steps.

 Follow these steps to hide the Task View button via the registry editor:

1. Press the **Win** **key** to open the **Start** **Menu**, type **Registry** **Editor** in the search bar, and press Enter.
2. Navigate to the following location:  
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced`
3. Double-click on the **ShowTaskViewButton** value in the right pane, type **0** in the **Value** **data**, and click **OK**. This will hide the Task View button from the taskbar.
