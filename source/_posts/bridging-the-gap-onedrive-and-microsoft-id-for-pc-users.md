## Bridging the Gap: OneDrive & Microsoft ID for PC Users

 Microsoft OneDrive offers a simple way to access your data and files, whichever device you may be using. But before everything is connected, you’ll need to link OneDrive on your computer to your Microsoft account. It is through this that you will be able to edit and retrieve the latest versions of your files across devices. Here’s how to do that.

## How to Set Up OneDrive on Your Windows 10 PC

 There are many[reasons you should use OneDrive](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-onedrive-personal-benefits/) ; if you’re not sure, read our guide on[what OneDrive is](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-onedrive/) . Here’s how to link your OneDrive with your Microsoft Account.

1. Look for the OneDrive icon in the taskbar notification area. If you don’t see it there, you may need to search in the Start menu for the application.

3. Click on the OneDrive icon in the taskbar notification area, and click on**Sign in** .

5. Then enter your Microsoft account password and click on**Sign in** . If you’ve set up two-step verification for your account, you’ll be asked to choose a method to verify your identity and have a code sent to you.
6. If you don’t have a Microsoft account, you can set one up by clicking on the**Create account** button. You’ll be taken to the Microsoft OneDrive page and you can set up your account. Once you’ve done that, return and follow steps 3 to 6.

 When you’ve signed in, the application will show you where your OneDrive folder is located. It defaults to your user folder.
