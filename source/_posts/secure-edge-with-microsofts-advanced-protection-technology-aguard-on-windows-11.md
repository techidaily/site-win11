## 4\. How to Install Microsoft Defender Application Guard Using Command Prompt

 If you are comfortable with the command prompt, you can also install Microsoft Defender Application Guard using the Command Prompt. Follow the steps here:

 Upon restarting the computer, you will have successfully installed Microsoft Defender Application Guard on your system. Now you can make sure that you are browsing in a secure and protected environment.

 If you ever want to uninstall Microsoft Defender Application Guard, you can do so by using the same PowerShell command. Just make sure to use**Disable** \-WindowsOptionalFeature instead of**Enable** . So, this way the command should look like this:

`Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName "Windows-Defender-ApplicationGuard"​`

 Now press Enter on your keyboard to execute the command and restart your system. Once it is done, Microsoft Defender Application Guard will be uninstalled from your PC.
