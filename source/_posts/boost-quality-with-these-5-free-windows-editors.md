## Boost Quality with These 5 FREE Windows Editors

 Creating a podcast has never been easier. All you have to do is record what you have to say and then find a way to share it with the world.

 But if you want your podcast to stand out, then making sure that it’s well-edited can be the difference between an episode two and never recording again.

 Luckily, there are a wide variety of different programs out there that can make editing podcasts easier than ever. Here are five of the best for you to look into.

## 1\. WavePad by NCH Software

 If you’ve never done much audio mixing or podcast editing before, then WavePad is a great tool to dip your toe in. You can record directly into WavePad or import your existing recordings just fine, and there are a ton of different tools to help you on your way.

 All of the basic functionality that you might expect from a free podcast editing program is here, such as tools to cut, copy, paste, pitch shift, and more.

 On top of this, WavePad includes a lot of other useful tools and effects for you to make the most of. This includes fades, audio normalization, amplifications, and noise removal effects. There are also a series of batch tools that you can use to join or edit many files, among others.

 WavePad is a great place to get started for anyone looking to edit their podcasts for free, regardless of experience. If you’re particularly new to podcast editing there are several video tutorials available from within WavePad itself, and if you find yourself getting the hang of things you may even soon want to look into [how to become a podcast editor](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-become-a-podcast-editor/).
