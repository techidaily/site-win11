## Mastering Window 11: Reinitializing Unwanted Apps

 Sometimes, there’s just no easy way of saving an app when it's not working properly on Windows.

 So how do you reset an app on Windows? Here’s what you need to know.

## How to Reset an App on Windows 11

## Windows Apps Just Need a Reset Sometimes

 If you don’t want the hassle of manually reinstalling an app, you can let Windows do it for you in the Settings app. Since this will be like installing a fresh copy of the app, be sure to reset it only when you’ve tried other ways to save the program.

 If you can’t reset an app in Settings, then you have to manually reinstall it.
