## 3\. Try a Different USB Cable

 A few users who’ve fixed error 0x80070141 have said they needed to change USB cables for connecting their phones. So, closely inspect the condition of your USB cable. If you have an alternative USB cable, try connecting your Apple mobile to your PC with it.

## 4\. Select the Keep Originals Option on Your iPhone

 Selecting the **Download and Keep Originals** iPhone option is one of the most widely confirmed fixes for error 0x80070141\. That option will transfer image files in their original HEIC format when selected. You can select **Keep Originals** on your iPhone like this:

1. Turn on your iPhone and tap Settings.
2. Select **Photos** in Settings.
3. Then select the **Keep Originals** transfer setting.
4. Also, select the **Download and Keep Originals** option from there.

 If this potential solution works, your transferred images will be in the HEIC format, which is not widely supported by Windows software. You can convert your HEIC files to JPG format with this [FreeConvert web app](https://www.freeconvert.com/heic-to-jpg). Click on that app’s **Choose Files** option, select your images, and press the **Convert** button.

 Alternatively, you can enable HEIC support on Windows by installing HEIF Image Extensions. Open this [HEIF Image Extensions](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/heif-image-extensions/9PMMSR1CGPWG?hl=en-gb&gl=gb&rtc=1) page and click the **Get in Store** app and **Open Microsoft Store** options. Select **Get** within the HEIF Image Extensions MS Store window.

## 5\. Shorten Long File Titles

 Error 0x80070141 can also occur because of overly long file names that exceed length restrictions in Windows. So, try shortening some images or videos with very long file names before attempting to transfer them onto Windows. This is how you can rename the files:

2. Then [open the Explorer file manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) and select your connected iPhone.
3. Right-click a file with a long name stored on your iPhone and select **Rename**.

## 9\. Utilize Cloud Storage Instead

You can sync files between your PC and mobile with the Google Drive desktop software.
