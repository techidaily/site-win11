## 2\. Connect Your Mobile to a Different USB Port

 There could be an issue with one of your PC’s USB ports. To check if that’s the case, try connecting your iPhone with a different USB slot on your PC. For example, plug your phone’s cable into a USB 2.0 slot instead of a USB 3.0 one.

## 3\. Try a Different USB Cable

 A few users who’ve fixed error 0x80070141 have said they needed to change USB cables for connecting their phones. So, closely inspect the condition of your USB cable. If you have an alternative USB cable, try connecting your Apple mobile to your PC with it.

## 4\. Select the Keep Originals Option on Your iPhone

 Selecting the **Download and Keep Originals** iPhone option is one of the most widely confirmed fixes for error 0x80070141\. That option will transfer image files in their original HEIC format when selected. You can select **Keep Originals** on your iPhone like this:

1. Turn on your iPhone and tap Settings.
2. Select **Photos** in Settings.
3. Then select the **Keep Originals** transfer setting.
4. Also, select the **Download and Keep Originals** option from there.

 If this potential solution works, your transferred images will be in the HEIC format, which is not widely supported by Windows software. You can convert your HEIC files to JPG format with this [FreeConvert web app](https://www.freeconvert.com/heic-to-jpg). Click on that app’s **Choose Files** option, select your images, and press the **Convert** button.

 Alternatively, you can enable HEIC support on Windows by installing HEIF Image Extensions. Open this [HEIF Image Extensions](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/heif-image-extensions/9PMMSR1CGPWG?hl=en-gb&gl=gb&rtc=1) page and click the **Get in Store** app and **Open Microsoft Store** options. Select **Get** within the HEIF Image Extensions MS Store window.
