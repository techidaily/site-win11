 The only thing worse than incorrect data in your spreadsheet is missing data. If you want to count the number of blank or empty cells in Microsoft Excel, we'll show you two quick and easy methods.

 By using a function, you can keep the number of blank cells parked in your sheet. This way, if you change your data, that count will adjust. If you prefer to simply see a fast [count of empty cells](https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-efficiently-recording-your-xbox-adventures/), you can use Excel's built-in Find feature. Let's take a look at both.

##  Count Blank Cells Using a Function

 The COUNT function in Microsoft Excel is handy for many scenarios. So with a variation of that function, you can count empty cells easily. The function is COUNTBLANK and here's how to use it.

 While the COUNTBLANK function in Google Sheets ignores cells that are empty (containing an empty string, 

        `""`
    
), Excel's version of the function does not make this distinction. Thus, COUNTBLANK will return a count of both blank and empty cells.

 Select the cell where you want to insert the function. This is the same cell that will display the count of blank cells. Type the following formula into the cell replacing the cell range with your own and hit Enter.

=COUNTBLANK(B2:F12)

 You should then see the number of empty cells in the range you selected for the formula.

 If you want to adjust the cell range, this is also simple. Click the cell containing the function, go up to the Formula Bar, and place your cursor within the cell range. You can manually change the cell references in the range or drag in or out on the blue box. Then, press Enter.

 You can also combine the COUNTBLANK function with itself to count the number of blank cells in different cell ranges of the same workbook. Type the following formula into the cell replacing the cell ranges with your own and press Enter.

=COUNTBLANK(B2:F12)+COUNTBLANK(J2:N12)

 Notice the cell ranges for each set are outlined in a different color making them easy to edit if needed.

 And you get the total count in one cell for both sets of cell ranges.
