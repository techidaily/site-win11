## Maximize Game Potential with These Pro-Gamers' Top Tips for Win 11

 Microsoft claims that Windows 11 is the best Windows OS for PC gaming. But avid gamers sometimes don't agree

 With Windows 11 fast becoming the next mainstream Windows OS, there are still a few improvements to make as far as gaming is concerned. For example, gamers have reported issues such as low FPS, lagging, and crashing.

 If you face these issues then this article may be what you need. Here are some tips for improving and enjoying gaming sessions on your Windows 11 PC.

## 1\. Turn On Game Mode

 Turning on Game Mode does a lot to improve gaming performance. It redirects more system resources to gaming applications, turns off notifications, and reduces most background activities, thus improving your gaming sessions.

 To enable it, click on the Windows icon from the taskbar and then open the**Settings** application. Once Settings is open, navigate to**Gaming > Game Mode** and toggle the**Game Mode** switch to the**On** position.

## 2\. Use Auto HDR

 High Dynamic Range (HDR) is a big improvement over its older brother, Standard Dynamic Range (SDR). HDR features some great additions to how games look, including better brightness representation and color depth.

 As such, try turning on Auto HDR. Simply head down to your**Settings** app and select**System** settings. Next, go to**Display** and click the**HDR** option.

![Screenshot showing how to switch on HDR](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/screenshot-of-display-screen-to-switch-on-hdr.JPG)

 Choose your display from the drop-down menu if you have multiple displays connected. Then, check under**Display Capabilities** . If the option to Use HDR is supported, toggle the options**Use HDR** and**Auto HDR** to the**On** positions.

 Once they're on you should be able to enjoy an immersive gaming experience. And if you're unsure as to what HDR does exactly, be sure to read[HDR vs. SDR: what's the difference?](https://www.makeuseof.com/hdr-vs-sdr-whats-the-difference/)

## 3\. Ensure Your Games Use Your Primary GPU

 For graphically-demanding games, it's a good idea to ensure they always use your PC's strongest GPU. Most gaming PCs have at least both a dedicated GPU and one built into the CPU, and it's best to give games the former to use.

 Once you follow the above steps to get into the Game Mode menu, select the**Graphics** option. This will display another default setting you may wish to change; using per-app GPU selection settings. You can also toggle on the**Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling** while you're here.

## 4\. Turn Off Enhanced Pointer Precision

 This tip to improve gaming experience is relatively unknown to gamers. In an attempt to enhance user experience, Windows 11 provides enhanced pointer precision to improve mouse movement.

 However, many games already implement a similar setting within their own control scehem. Consequently, these two settings conflict with each other, causing the mouse pointer to move less efficiently. This is the direct opposite of what the setting was meant to achieve.

 For gaming computers, the best thing to do is to disable enhanced pointer precision. Search for**Mouse Settings** in the Windows search bar and open it. Next, scroll down to the**Related Settings** section and click on**Additional Mouse Settings** .

![How to turn off enhanced pointer precision on Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/enhanced-pointer-precision.jpg)

 This action opens the**Mouse Properties** menu. From there, open the**Pointer Options** tab and untick the**Enhanced pointer precision** checkbox. Click**Apply** then**OK** to save your changes.

## 5\. Update Your GPU's Drivers

 NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and other graphics cards are at their peak performance when their drivers are up-to-date. So, to enjoy a good gaming experience, you must update your GPU drivers regularly.

 Factory-installed graphics card drivers are very likely behind on several updates. As such, you must take time to update GPU drivers on new PCs before installing or running games.

 There are a few ways you can update your GPU's drivers, from downloading them manually to using special software released by the GPU's manufacturer. Fortunately, all the[ways to update your GPU on Windows 10](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/) also work on Windows 11.

## 6\. Update Windows

 Just as it's important to update your GPU drivers, it's also best to regularly update the Windows 11 OS on your PC. Before you install games and applications on your PC you should check if there are any pending OS updates. These usually come with performance and user experience improvements.

 If you're not sure how to do this, be sure to read[how to install Windows 11 updates](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-install-updates/) for more information. Note that Windows won't automatically update on metered connections. So if you’re on one, you must manually check for pending updates periodically.
