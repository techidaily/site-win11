## Mastery of Languages on Demand Through Windows Keyboard Shortcuts

 Sometimes you may need to translate content from foreign websites or documents to your native language; most users probably rely on translation features integrated within Google and Microsoft software. The MS Office apps incorporate a built-in translator feature, and you can utilize cloud-based Microsoft and Google translators in Edge and Chrome.

 However, there are also some good alternative translator tools you can utilize across all Windows software. QTranslate and DeepL are two utilities with which you can translate text by pressing hotkeys. This is how you can add translate text passages with those apps’ hotkeys in Windows 11/10.

## How to Translate Text in Windows Software With QTranslate

 QTranslate is among the [best free translation apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-free-translator-apps/) for Windows platforms dating back to XP. It enables you to translate text in all Windows software with nine cloud-based translator services (including Microsoft and Google). However, the best thing about this software is its hotkey functionality for translating selected text. You can translate text passages with QTranslate like this:

1. Open [the QTranslate](http://quest-app.appspot.com/home) website.
2. Click the**Download QTranslate** button.
3. Press File Explorer’s button (the one with a folder library icon) on your taskbar.
4. Go to whatever folder has the QTranslate setup file in it.
5. Double-click the**Qtranslate.6.10.0.exe** installer file.
6. Select the**I Agree** and**Install** options for QTranslate. The software will then automatically start after installation so long as you kept the Run QTranslate checkbox selected.

7. Open a website in a foreign language to try out the translator. For the sake of example, this [German Microsoft Store page](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/store/b/microsoftunddu) will do.
8. Select some text to translate on the website, and press the**Ctrl** +**Q** hotkey. A popup window with an English translation for your selected foreign text will open.  
![The QTranslate popup window for translations](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/qtranslate-popup-window.jpg)

 The popup window that opens includes a few options. You can select different translation services at the bottom of the window. Click the star button to save it to your favorites. Add the translated text to the clipboard by selecting the**Copy selection to clipboard** option.

 You can view the main QTranslate translation window by selecting text and pressing the**Ctrl** key twice. That window displays the selected foreign text alongside the translated content. There you can change the translation by choosing a different language on the drop-down menu and clicking**Translate** . Click the**Listen** **to text** (headphone) buttons to play an audio text-to-speech translation.

 To view your translation history, press the**Ctrl** +**H** hotkey. That keyboard shortcut opens a window that displays a list of text passages you’ve translated in QTranslate. There you can select to save translations or clear the list.

### How to Customise QTranslate

 You can reconfigure QTranslate’s hotkeys via its**Options** window. Right-click the**QTranslate** system tray icon and select**Options** . Select the**Hotkeys** tab on the setting window. Then double-click an action there to bring up a keyboard shortcut window for it. Press a different key combination, and click the**OK** \>**Apply** buttons.

 If you want the software to start with Windows, click the**Basics** tab. Selecting the**Start with Windows** checkbox will add QTranslate to the startup apps. You can also change the software’s first, second, and interface languages from that tab.

 QTranslate also incorporates some**Appearance** settings with which you can customize its user interface. Click the**Theme** drop-down menu there to choose a different window style. You can customize the software’s colors by clicking the**Text** and**Frame Color** options.

## How to Translate Text in Windows Software With DeepL

 DeepL is the online translator service's official Windows desktop program. That software has freemium, starter, advanced, and ultimate versions. The freemium version has a 5,000-word character translation limit. DeepL has similar hotkey functionality to QTranslate with which you can translate text passages as follows:

1. Open [the DeepL](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Office-tools/Other-Office-Tools/DeepL.shtml) [Softpedia download page](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Office-tools/Other-Office-Tools/DeepL.shtml) .
2. Select**Download Now** on that page, and click the**Softpedia Secure Download (US)** option.
3. Double-click**DeepLSetup.exe** to install the software.
4. After installing, DeepL will automatically start and prompt you to set up an account. However, you can skip it, as having one is not essential.
5. Now open up this [French Microsoft page](https://www.microsoft.com/fr-fr/store/b/home%E2%80%AF%E2%80%AF) to try out DeepL.
6. Select a text passage to translate.
7. Press the**Ctrl** +**C** hotkey twice to bring up the DeepL translation window. That window shows the selected text alongside an English translation for it.  
![The DeepL translation window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-deepl-translation-window.jpg)

 There you can select different languages to translate by clicking the drop-down menu on the right side of the DeepL window. You can also look up translations for specific words. Select a word with the cursor and click**Dictionary entries** at the bottom of the window to look it up.

### How to Translate Files With DeepL

 DeepL also enables you to select files to translate. Click the**Translate Files** tab at the top of its window. Then press the**Browse** button to select a file for translation and click the**Open** .

![The Translate files tab](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-translate-files-tab.jpg)

**Ctrl** +**F9** is an alternative hotkey you can press for DeepL translations. Selecting text and pressing**Ctrl** +**F9** will bring up a smaller quick translate window. There you can click a**Copy** option to add the translation to your clipboard for pasting elsewhere.

![The main QTranslate translation window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-main-qtranslate-window.jpg)

 If you would like to change the keyboard shortcuts, click the menu button at the top right of DeepL’s window. Select Settings to view hotkey options for the software. There you can select alternative**Alt** ,**Ctrl** ,**Key** , and**Shift** keys for each hotkey. Click in the boxes to set combination keys by pressing them.

 DeepL has a hotkey for a text-capturing translation feature that isn’t enabled by default. Click the**Capture text on screen** option in the settings to enable that feature. Pressing**Ctrl** +**F8** will activate a tool with which you can select text for translation by dragging a grey box over it.

 DeepL matches your system’s dark or light mode by default. However, you can select for the app to be dark or light. Click the**Select dark or light mode** drop-down menu to choose your preference.

## Translate Text With Handy Hotkeys in Windows

 QTranslate’s and DeepL’s hotkeys enable you to quickly and easily translate in Windows 11 and 10\. You can press those convenient keyboard shortcuts to translate text in websites and documents across all Windows software whenever needed. The hotkey functionality those software packages provide makes them preferable alternatives to the Google and Microsoft translation tools.
