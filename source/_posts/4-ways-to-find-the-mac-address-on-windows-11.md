## 4 Ways to Find the MAC Address on Windows 11

 Every device that connects to the internet has a Media Access Control (MAC) address that uniquely identifies it online. Your Windows PC, smartphone, tablet, and smartwatch have a unique MAC address that allows it to communicate with other devices over the internet.

 So, how do you find your Windows 11's MAC address? Read on to find out.
