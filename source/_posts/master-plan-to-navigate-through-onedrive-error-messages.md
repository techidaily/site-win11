## 2\. Check Your Internet Connection

 A slow or unstable internet connection might be the reason why OneDrive displays the “Sorry, there is a problem with the OneDrive servers” error. If you have a faulty internet connection, OneDrive will have a hard time connecting to the server and synchronizing your data.

 If OneDrive isn’t the only app malfunctioning due to an improper connection, you should[fix your unstable internet connection](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-slow-unstable-wi-fi-connection/) .

## 3\. Delete OneDrive Cache

 Like any other app on your computer, OneDrive stores and uses cache, so it doesn’t download the same data every time. But if the cache gets corrupted, you’ll run into all sorts of issues, including the server error.

 To remove the OneDrive cache, launch a Run dialog by pressing**Win + R** . Then, type**wsreset.exe** and press**Enter** .
