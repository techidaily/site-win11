## Tackling Windows Woes: A Script Error Cure-All Guide

 The script error occurs when you try to visit a specific website or perform an action such as posting a comment on a social media platform. It is also common on apps such as Windows Mail, and now deprecated Internet Explorer. The error occurs when the browser detects an error in the webpage. If the error occurs on specific websites, you can disable script debugging to stop the annoying pop-up.

 Alternatively, removing conflicting browser extensions, clearing your Internet cache, and updating the app can also help. Follow the below steps to troubleshoot this error on your Windows computer.

## 1\. Disable Script Debugging in Internet Options

 Script debugging is a developer feature that lets web admins debug web applications. Windows, by default, disables script debugging to prevent end users from receiving unnecessary debug notification pop-ups when they visit a website or use a web app.

 You may receive script error notifications if you have enabled script debugging in Internet Options. Follow these steps to check and disable the option to stop the error notification.

1. Press**Win + R** to open**Run** .
2. Type**control** and click**OK** to open**Control Panel.**
3. Next, click on**Network and Internet.**

4. Click on**Internet Options.**
5. In the Internet Properties dialog, open the**Advanced** tab.
6. Scroll down to the**Browsing** section under**Settings** .  
![Internet-properties-disable-script-debugging](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/interenet-properties-disable-script-debugging.jpg)
7. Check**Disable script debugging (Other)** . Also, uncheck**Disable script debugging** **(Internet Explorer)** if available.
8. Click**Apply** and**OK** to save the changes.
9. Relaunch your web browser or the app and check if the error is resolved.

 With the script debugging disabled, your web browser will stop showing debugging notifications when an error is detected.

 However, if the issue persists, clear your browser cache to delete the old cache that may be triggering the error.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
5. In the**Turn off** dialog, click the drop-down for**When you want to resume Real-Time Scanning?** By default, it is set to 15 minutes, which should be sufficient to determine if the antivirus is creating conflict with your browser.
6. Click**Turn off** to disable the antivirus.

 Close McAfee and relaunch the browser. Try to browse the web app or page and check if the error is resolved. The antivirus should resume real-time scanning once the time lapses.
