## Preventing Interruptions During Steam Video Streaming

 Steam Broadcasting is a great way to stream PC games with your friends in real time. While as cool as it sounds, things can go south while broadcasting. For instance, many users have flooded the Steam community site with reports mentioning all kinds of Steam Broadcasting errors.

 If you're also facing problems, keep reading as we cover our recommended fixes for the more common Steam Broadcasting issues on Windows.

## 1\. How to Fix Steam Broadcasting Audio or Video Quality Problems

 Using Steam Broadcasting is practically a one-click process. You need to adjust the broadcast's privacy settings in Steam. That's it. However, if you're witnessing audio or video quality issues while broadcasting, you need to be quick to fix them.

 The common reason behind such issues could be your incorrectly configured Steam settings and your network issue.

 Steam provides two important options that impact your Broadcast quality;**Video Dimensions** and**Maximum Bitrate** . Setting both options wisely can help you improve your stream significantly.

 Here's how you can solve the audio and video problems by adjusting the above two options:

1. Open Steam and navigate to**Steam > Settings** from the top menu bar.
2. Click**Broadcast** and change the**Video Dimensions** to your PC’s display resolution or lower it by one step. For example, if your PC supports 1920 x 1080 and below, set it accordingly on Steam.  
![Steam Broadcast All Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/steam-broadcast-all-settings.jpg)
3. Change the default**Maximum Bitrate** to**3000 kbit/s** if your PC has a strong Wi-Fi connection. If not, bring it down to**2000 kbit/s** .
4. You can also change the**Optimize encoding for** option to**Best Quality** . This ensures a good quality output to your broadcast viewers at the expense of higher data consumption.

 That's it. Hopefully, now your friends can enjoy the stream without any issues.

## 2\. How to Fix Steam Broadcasting Stuck in Endless Loading

![Steam Broadcast Endless Loading Preview](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/steam-endless-loading-preview.jpg)

 Sometimes when you start playing a broadcast, it gets stuck there and never loads. So, what else could be more frustrating than watching an endless loading animation?

 Below are some possible causes behind the endless loading with the recommended troubleshooting tips:

* **Poor internet connection:** Your internet connection may be at fault, causing the broadcast not to load properly. To solve this, learn [how to speed up your internet on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-internet-speed-windows-tweaks/) so your PC can handle the broadcast.
* **A corrupted browser DNS cache:** If you’re watching the broadcast on a browser, ensure you [clear your browser’s DNS cache](https://www.makeuseof.com/chrome-edge-firefox-safari-opera-browser-clear-dns-cache/) first. Then, restart your computer and re-check for the issue.
* **An ad blocker is active:** While ad blockers block only the ads "mostly'', they sometimes mess with a website's functionality too. It could be the case with you as well. To check, you must disable your current ad blocker and restart the browser once.

 If your web browser shows that "your web browser does not support the minimum set of features required to watch this broadcast," it means that your web browser is not compatible with Steam Broadcasting's requirements. So, you've to ensure you are using a compatible browser.

* Steam Client’s browser
* Google Chrome (version 39+)
