 If you're also facing problems, keep reading as we cover our recommended fixes for the more common Steam Broadcasting issues on Windows.

## 1\. How to Fix Steam Broadcasting Audio or Video Quality Problems

 Using Steam Broadcasting is practically a one-click process. You need to adjust the broadcast's privacy settings in Steam. That's it. However, if you're witnessing audio or video quality issues while broadcasting, you need to be quick to fix them.

 The common reason behind such issues could be your incorrectly configured Steam settings and your network issue.

 Steam provides two important options that impact your Broadcast quality;**Video Dimensions** and**Maximum Bitrate** . Setting both options wisely can help you improve your stream significantly.

 Here's how you can solve the audio and video problems by adjusting the above two options:

1. Open Steam and navigate to**Steam > Settings** from the top menu bar.
2. Click**Broadcast** and change the**Video Dimensions** to your PC’s display resolution or lower it by one step. For example, if your PC supports 1920 x 1080 and below, set it accordingly on Steam.

 So, if you’re unable to watch the Steam, either you’re not on the friend list of the broadcaster, or the broadcast may be limited to access-only viewers. In such a situation, you must contact the host to modify the**Broadcast Privacy setting** accordingly.
