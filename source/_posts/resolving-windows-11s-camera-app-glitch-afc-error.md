## Resolving Windows 11'S Camera App Glitch: AFC Error

 Webcams are essential for video conference calls and making videos. However, some users can’t use their webcams with the Windows Camera app because of the 0xA00F429F error. The error shows a “Can’t start your camera” message with the code 0xA00F429F (and 0x887A0004) in the Windows Camera app.

 That issue can be a big inconvenience for users who often utilize the Camera app. If error 0xA00F429F is preventing you from recording with the Camera app, here is how you can fix it in Windows 11 and 10.

## 1\. Enable Webcam Access for the Affected Apps

 You can’t use your PC’s webcam with Windows Camera if camera access for apps is disabled. So, check the basic camera access settings for apps are enabled in Windows before anything else. You can enable webcam app access within Windows 11' Settings like this:

1. Press**Win + I** to access the Settings app quickly.
2. Select**Privacy & security** to view navigation options for that tab.
3. Click**Camera** to go to bring up the app access settings for the webcam.

5. Then toggle on the Windows Camera app access setting.

 The Settings app’s layout is a little different in Windows 10, but you can still configure camera access much the same. Click**Privacy** \>**Camera** in Windows 10’s Settings app to reach the required options. Then click the**Change** button to turn on the**Camera** access for this device option.

## 2\. Enable and Start the Windows Camera Frame Server Service

 Error 0xA00F429F can often be due to a disabled Windows Camera Frame Server service. Some users who’ve needed to resolve the 0xA00F429F error have confirmed that enabling and starting the service fixed the issue. This is how you can enable and start the Windows Camera Frame Server service:

1. To open the Windows Services app, press**Win + R** . Then input the**services.msc** Run command and click**OK** to view Services.
2. Double-click**Windows Camera Frame Server** to open that service’s properties window.

4. Click**Start** (in the properties window) if the Windows Camera Frame Server service isn’t running.
5. Select the**Log on** tab for the service.  
![The Local System account option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/local-system-account-option.jpg)
6. Click the**Local System account** checkbox if that option isn’t selected.
7. Press the Windows Camera Frame Server service’s**Apply** button.
8. Click**OK** to exit.

## 3\. Edit the Platform Registry Key

 Another confirmed fix for error 0xA00F429F is to edit the**Platform** registry key by creating a new EnableFrameServerMode DWORD. If you’re not entirely comfortable with editing the registry, you can[create a registry backup in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) first before proceeding with this potential solution. Just make sure you tweak the registry exactly as follows:

1. Open Registry Editor by launching Run (**Win + R**), inputting**regedit.exe** , and selecting**OK** .
2. Clear whatever path is in Registry Editor’s address bar, and input the following key location:  
`Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows Media Foundation\Platform`
3. Right-click the**Platform** key and select**New** \>**DWORD (32-bit) Value** .  
![The DWORD (32-bit) Value option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/enableframeservermode-dword.jpg)
4. Then input**EnableFrameServerMode** in the DWORD’s name box.
5. Double-click the**EnableFrameServerMode** DWORD.
6. Set the**EnableFrameServerMode** value to**0** and click**OK** .  
![The Edit DWORD window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/edit-dword-value-window.jpg)
7. Restart Windows before opening Windows Camera again.

## 4\. Reset the Camera App

 One of the best ways to resolve issues with the Camera app is to reset it. So, it’s recommended users try doing that to fix error 0xA00F429F.

 You can clear the data for Windows Camera as covered in our[how to reset apps in Windows 10 and 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-reset-app/) guide. While you’re at it, you can also try selecting Camera’s**Repair** option if resetting the app doesn’t make a difference.

## 5\. Allow the Camera App Through Windows Defender Firewall

 Another possible reason for error 0xA00F429F is the Windows DefenderfFirewall, which could be blocking the Camera app’s connectivity. So, check your firewall’s settings to make sure that the Windows Camera app is allowed through it.

 Our guide on[allowing apps through the Windows Defender firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-allow-apps-windows-firewall/) provides full instructions for how to apply this resolution.

 The same also applies to users who’ve installed third-party firewalls or antivirus software packages that include them. Check the app permission list for any third-party firewall, and select to permit Windows Camera through it.

## 6\. Disable the Camera Shields in Third-Party Antivirus Software Packages

 Also, note that some antivirus software packages have camera shields that prevent apps from accessing webcams. For example, Avast Premium Security is one such antivirus tool that incorporates a Webcam Shield feature. If you have installed third-party antivirus software, check to see if it has such a camera shield and disable it if it’s enabled.

## 7\. Update Your Webcam’s Driver

 The error 0xA00F429F message suggests updating camera drivers as a potential solution for this issue. That highlights this error can arise because of an outmoded or faulty camera device driver on your PC. So, try updating the driver for your PC’s webcam if it needs updating.

![The Driver Booster window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/driver-booster-software.jpg)

 The easiest way to check for outdated device drivers and update them on your PC is to utilize driver updater software. Such apps will scan your PC and tell you if your camera driver needs updating.

2. Then enter and execute this command to remove the Camera app:
