## How to Reactivate Grammarly, an Inactive Service

 Grammarly is the most popular writing and grammar-checking tool for writers. Besides the browser extension, it also provides a Windows app that works on most apps and websites.

 As good as it sounds, you may encounter issues with their Windows app in some situations. There are multiple reasons behind this, such as an outdated app version or corrupted app files.

 In this article, we will guide you through some quick steps to fix common Grammarly app issues on Windows.

## What Are Some Common Grammarly App Issues on Windows?

 There's no doubt that Grammarly simplifies your writing workflow. You write the content, Grammarly checks for grammatical mistakes, and then you edit it accordingly. However, there are several errors you may encounter while using Grammarly.

 Below are some common Grammarly errors for reference:

* **Grammar detection is not working**
* **Frequent app crashes on Windows**
* **Grammarly is not working on some websites**

 The best part is that you can troubleshoot most of these issues quickly. So, review the steps below and get your Grammarly app working on your Windows computer.

## 1\. Troubleshoot Using General Fixes

 There are [many reasons to use Grammarly](https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-use-grammarly-as-content-writer/) to improve your writing. However, it might sometimes run into issues, particularly on Windows.

 But don't worry; below are some quick solutions to try if Grammarly is not working correctly:

* **Check Grammarly's server status:** Visit the [Grammarly Status](https://status.grammarly.com/) website to check for a server outage or downtime. Sometimes, the Grammarly API and servers go offline. And so, you can not use it during that time.
* **Troubleshoot your slow Internet connection:** A slow Internet connection may not be ideal while using Grammarly. So, refer to our [guide on fixing slow internet](https://www.makeuseof.com/internet-slow-on-windows-laptop-not-on-phone/) for help.
* **Turn off your proxy or VPN:** Such networking services sometimes interfere with Grammarly. We recommend disabling any proxy or VPN to check if it resolves the issue.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 2\. Update the Grammarly App

 One of the best ways to ensure your Grammarly app works correctly is to keep it up-to-date.

 But here's the kicker: Grammarly does not include an update option within the app settings! So, the only option is to download an updated version from the internet and install it.

 Here's how you can update the Grammarly app on Windows:

1. Visit the [Grammarly for Desktop](https://www.grammarly.com/desktop) webpage and click **Download Grammarly**.
2. Open your **Downloads** folder and run the **GrammarlyInstaller.exe** file.
3. After the installation, click **Sign in to your existing account**.  
![Grammarly Setup Screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/grammarly-setup-screen.jpg)
4. Once you log in with your account, click the **Activate Grammarly** button.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 That's it. To verify if the issue persists, open Microsoft Word or any website where you can write (e.g., [ControlC.com](https://controlc.com/)). Start writing a sentence and see if Grammarly provides suggestions.

## 3\. Adjust Your System and Grammarly Settings

 Grammarly's Windows client offers limited settings to adjust. However, you can manage two crucial settings to resolve most Grammarly issues: block list and Grammarly startup settings.

### 1\. Clear the Grammarly Block List

 Sometimes, Grammarly may stop working on specific websites or apps. This issue mainly occurs when you add them to the block list unknowingly.

 Don't worry; clearing the block list lets you use Grammarly without issues on all previously blocked websites or apps.

 Follow these steps to clear its block list contents:

1. Open the Grammarly app on your computer.
2. Click **Settings** in the bottom left corner of the window.  
![Grammarly App Windows Home Screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/grammarly-app-homescreen.jpg)
3. Open the **Block List** tab and click **Remove** next to any website you want to exclude.  
![Grammarly Blocklist Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/grammarly-blocklist-settings.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Note that the settings should apply automatically once you click **Remove**; if it doesn't, restart the app once.

### 2\. Enable Grammarly at Startup

 If you don't want to open the app manually before writing, set it to run at startup. This will solve the issue where Grammarly spell check doesn't work instantly.

 Here are the steps to enable Grammarly on Windows startup:

1. [Open the Windows Task Manager app](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-access-task-manager-on-windows-11/).
2. Click on the **Startup apps** tab.
3. Locate the **Grammarly** app in the list and right-click on it. Click **Enable** from the context menu to launch Grammarly whenever you boot up your computer.  
![Grammarly Startup Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/grammarly-startup-settings.jpg)

## 4\. Sign Out and Sign In Again

 If Grammarly is not functioning as expected, try signing out and signing in again.

 The logic here is: logging out disconnects you from Grammarly's server and clears your computer's temporary files and cache. This trick often solves most issues, such as spell check not working and [Grammarly not working on Microsoft Word](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-grammarly-add-in-not-working-microsoft-word/).

 To sign out from the Grammarly app, click the **Settings** option on its home screen. Then, navigate to the **Account** tab and click the **Sign out** button.

## 5\. Clear Grammarly's AppData Folder

 Each application on Windows, including Grammarly, has its own AppData folder. This folder is where the application stores necessary files and data. While this is perfectly normal, these stored files can occasionally become corrupted, leading to various errors.

 If Grammarly is still not working, clearing the AppData folder might help you. Follow the below-given steps to clear Grammarly's AppData on Windows:

1. Press the **Win + R** keys to open the **Run** app.
2. Type **%appdata%/Grammarly** into the search field and press **OK**.
3. Right-click on the **DesktopIntegrations** folder and click the **Delete** icon.  
![Grammarly AppData Folder](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/grammarly-appdata-folder.jpg)
4. Now restart your Grammarly app.

 For a quick test, you can [open Grammarly inside Google Docs](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-install-use-grammarly-google-docs/) and see where the suggestion sidebar appears.

 Clearing the AppData folder will erase any locally saved information associated with the Grammarly app. For instance, any websites you have on Grammarly's block list and any personalized settings will reset. So, back up or note them down before deleting its AppData folder.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. Repair Microsoft .NET Framework

 The .NET Framework is a toolkit containing many development-related tools for Windows developers. Now, how is this related to the Grammarly app?

 Simply put, the Grammarly app (like other Windows apps) uses some components from this toolkit. So, when the .NET Framework or a part of it gets corrupted, Grammarly might start crashing or freezing at the startup.

 To fix this, here's how you can repair the Microsoft .NET Framework on Windows:

1. Visit the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30135) page and download the **Microsoft .NET Framework Repair Tool**.
2. Run the **NetFxRepairTool.exe** file that you just downloaded.
3. Click the **Next** button to proceed with the setup.

## 7\. Reinstall the Grammarly App

 If all previous methods fail, uninstalling and reinstalling the Grammarly app is the last resort.

 Follow the below-given steps to reinstall Grammarly on Windows:

1. Launch the Windows **Settings** app. Then, go to **Apps > Installed apps**.
2. Search for **Grammarly for Windows** app and click the three-dot menu next to it.
3. Select **Uninstall** to start the uninstallation process. If it asks for confirmation, click **Yes**.  
![Windows Installed App Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/windows-installed-app-settings.jpg)
4. Download and install the app again from [Grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/desktop).

 Avoid downloading "cracked or modded versions" of freemium apps and services (like Grammarly), as they may contain malware that can harm your system!

 Reinstalling the Grammarly app is a one-shot process that resolves any ongoing issues with the app. If you're still experiencing difficulties, contact [Grammarly's support](https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new#/) for further action.
