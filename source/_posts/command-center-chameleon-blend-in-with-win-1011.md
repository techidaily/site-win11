## Command Center Chameleon: Blend in with Win 10/11

 The Power button on your Windows Start menu is a handy tool to quickly shut down your Windows 10 or 11\. Just click on the Start button from the taskbar below, and you will find the Power button in the bottom-left corner.

 It also has many disadvantages, though. Kids, or even an unauthorized person for that matter, can also shut down your PC accidentally. To prevent such unauthorized usage, you can hide the Power button on your PC for good.

### 1\. Hide the Power Button on the Start Menu with the Windows Registry

 To hide the Power Button through the Windows Registry, all you have to do is change a critical value, and your job will be done. However, before you jump in and do that, it’s essential that you [back up your Windows registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) first. Fiddling with the Registry is risky business, and having your keys backed up will keep it safe even in the case of accidental data loss.

 After you have backed up your Windows Registry, follow the below steps to hide the Power button on your Windows:

1. Launch the **Run** dialog box by pressing the **Windows key + R** shortcut.
2. Type in 'regedit' and hit **Enter**.
3. In the Registry Editor, head to the following location:  
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PolicyManager\default\Start\HidePowerButton
4. Right-click on the **Value** key from the right and change its value to **1**.
