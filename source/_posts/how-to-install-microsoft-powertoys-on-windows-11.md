 To install Microsoft PowerToys from the Microsoft Store, follow these steps:

1. Press **Win + Q** and type **Microsoft Store** in the search bar.
2. Click on the **Microsoft Store** icon in the search results.
3. On the Microsoft Store page, search for **PowerToys**. The next page will provide a detailed overview of the software package. Please read it carefully before continuing.
4. If you feel satisfied, click **Install** to begin the downloading & installation process. The process might take a few minutes.
