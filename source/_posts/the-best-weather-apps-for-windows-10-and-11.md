 To customize the widget, click the three-dots menu and select Customize. Here, you can change the location and switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit. You can use Microsoft’s MSN Weather app for Windows if you need more.

## 5\. MyRadar

![Myradar Windows Weather App App Running on Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/myradar-windows-weather-app.jpg)

 MyRadar may not be as popular amongst Windows users, but it has over 50 million downloads on iOS and Android platforms. It is a weather forecast app that displays animated weather radar for your current location.

 You can select your region or view other parts of the map with scroll-to-zoom. With the region selected, click on the Forecast icon to view the temperature, Air Quality Index, and precipitation forecast at a glance.

 You can also view the hourly forecast for the day and up to 10 days of forecast predictions for temperature, precipitation, winds, and cloud cover. It also offers weather warnings and alerts in your area via push notifications.

 On the flip side, MyRadar is not available in all countries, which may also affect its accuracy. For example, it’ll be more likely to show an accurate weather forecast to someone living in Santa Fe than someone living in India. So, your mileage may vary depending on where you live.

**Download**: [MyRadar](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/myradar/9WZDNCRFHZN6) (Free, premium version available)

## 6\. SimpleWeather

![Simpleweather Windows App Running on Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/simpleweather-windows-app.jpg)

 SimpleWeather, as the name indicates, is a simple weather app to get the forecast for your current and other locations. The home screen shows the day's current, highest, and lowest temperature. As you scroll down, it’ll display the forecast for the next few days, hourly weather details, UV Index, and Air Quality Index.

 During setup, you can choose the location, weather forecast update frequency, and your preferred temperature measurement unit to set up the app. In the left pane, you can view severe weather alerts, the weather radar, and your favorite locations.

 SimpleWeather works well for the most part, except when it chooses to crash when you try to access the radar feature. It also fails to save your initial setup configuration and requires you to re-do it.
