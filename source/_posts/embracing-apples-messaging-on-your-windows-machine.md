 As long as you have notifications enabled on the Phone Link app, you will get an alert when the other person responds.

## An Alternative Method to Use iMessage on Windows

 If you don't want to use the Phone Link, there is an alternate, albeit more complicated, way to interact with iMessage on your Windows PC. This method involves using the Remote Desktop extension for Chrome, which you can download from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chrome-remote-desktop/inomeogfingihgjfjlpeplalcfajhgai) . However, you will also need a Mac and Windows computer and install the extension on both devices.

 Launch Messages on your Mac and share the screen with the Windows PC using the Remote Desktop extension. You can then interact with iMessage on the PC through the shared screen.

 If your messages aren’t going through or the Remote Desktop extension isn’t working, first check whether the [Windows PC is connected to the Internet](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-connect-to-wifi/) and ensure you have a [stable network connection](https://www.makeuseof.com/check-stability-internet-connection-windows/) . Of course, if you aren't able to send someone a message, whether on a PC or your iPhone, the person may have [blocked you on iMessage](https://www.makeuseof.com/check-if-someone-blocked-you-imessage/) .
