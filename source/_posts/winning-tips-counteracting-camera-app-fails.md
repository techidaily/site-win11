## Winning Tips: Counteracting Camera App Fails

 Many users capture webcam photos with the pre-installed Windows 11/10 Camera app. However, some users have reported an error code that appears when they click on Windows Camera’s "take photo" button that reads “0xA00F424F <PhotoCaptureFileCreationFailed> (0x80131500).”

 The code’s error message says, “Sorry, we weren’t able to save the photo.” As you might expect, the Camera app won't save any new photos when this error appears. As such, this is how you can fix the “photo capture file creation failed” error on Windows.

## 1\. Check the Camera Access Permission Settings

 First, check that webcam access permission is set for the Camera app. This is how you can enable apps to access the webcam in Windows:

1. Click **Settings** on your Start menu.
2. Select the **Privacy** tab/category.
3. Click on **Camera** to view app permission settings for the webcam.

4. Toggle on the **Let apps access your camera** (or **Allow apps**) setting.  
![The Let apps access your camera setting](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/let-apps-access-your-camera.jpg)
5. Turn on the switch for the **Camera** app setting.

 Windows has a **Reset** troubleshooting option for fixing apps that aren’t working right. Resetting the Windows Camera app will clear its data. That’s worth a try since it’s a straightforward potential fix to apply.

 Our guide on [how to reset a Window app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-reset-app/) includes instructions for applying this potential fix in Windows 11 and 10\.

## 3\. Create a New Camera Roll Folder

 The “photo capture file creation failed” error can occur because the Camera Roll folder has been deleted. Users confirm creating a new Camera Roll folder can fix this issue when the old one has been deleted. You can create a new Camera Roll folder like this:

1. Open File Explorer with the **Win + E** keyboard shortcut.
2. Then go to this folder path:  
`C:\Users\<user folder>\Pictures\`
3. If you can’t find Camera Roll in the Pictures folder or any subfolder there (such as Screenshots), you’ll need to recreate that folder. Right-click inside the Pictures directory and select **New** \> **Folder**.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. Input **Camera Roll** to be the new folder’s name and press **Enter**.

 Also, check if the Camera Roll folder has been moved out of the Pictures folder to another directory. If it has, moving Camera Roll back into the default Pictures location could also resolve this issue.

## 4\. Set a Different Camera Roll Library Location

 Setting a different Camera Roll library save location is another fix that’s worked for some users. To do so, you’ll need to add and set a new save location within the Camera Roll Properties window as follows:

1. [Open the Run dialog](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) and input the following path in the **Open** box:  
`%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Libraries`
2. Click **OK** to bring up a Libraries directory.
3. Right-click Camera Roll to select **Properties**.  
![The Properties option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/properties-option3.jpg)
4. Click **Add** on the **Library** tab.
5. Next, select a folder location such as **Downloads**.

1. Right-click inside the Include Folder in the Camera Roll window to select **New** \> **Folder**.
2. Enter **Photo** for the new folder title.
3. Click the **Include folder** button.  
![The Include folder button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/include-folder-button.jpg)
4. Select the Photo folder in the **Library locations** box.
5. Click **Save set** **location**.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
6. Select **Apply** to set the new save location.
7. Click on **OK** to exit the **Camera Roll Properties** window.

 Some users also say that restoring default locations in the **Library** tab worked for them. To do that, click the **Restore Defaults** button in the Camera Roll Properties window.

## 5\. Change Where Your Photos and Videos Get Saved

 Some Camera users have also said changing where that app saves pictures can resolve the “photo capture file creation failed.” If you have an external drive, alternative partitions, or USB stick, you can set photos to save there as follows:

1. Open the file and app search utility with the **Win + S** keyboard shortcut.
2. Next, type **Default save locations** in the search tool’s box.
3. Select **Default save locations** to bring up those settings.
4. Then click the **New** **photos and videos will be saved** to option.  
![The default save location settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/default-save-location-settings.jpg)
5. Select a different drive or partition to save images to.
6. Click **Apply** to set the new location.

 If you don’t have any alternative place for saving photos, you could [set up a new drive partition with Disk Management](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-partition-hard-drive/). Then select to save photos to the new drive partition within Settings.

1. Press **Win + S** and type "PowerShell".
2. Select to [open PowerShell with admin permissions](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-powershell-administrator/#) by clicking its **Run as administrator** option.
3. Then input this command to view the apps list:  
`Get-AppxPackage`
4. Click the PowerShell window title bar with your right mouse button to select the **Edit** and **Find** context menu options.
5. Input **camera** in the **Find what** box.

1. Click **Find Next** to highlight the Camera app in the list.

2. Then copy the app’s PackageFullName ID by selecting its text and pressing **Ctrl** \+ **C**. The PackageFullName will be something like Microsoft.WindowsCamera\_2023.2305.4.0\_x64\_\_8wekyb3d8bbwe, but it can vary depending on the app version.
3. Input and execute this command with the PackageFullName included:  
`Remove-AppxPackage PackageFullName`  
![The Remove-AppxPackage command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/remove-apppackage-command.jpg)

6. Press **Get** to reinstall Windows Camera.
