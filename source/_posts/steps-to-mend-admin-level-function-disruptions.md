## Steps to Mend Admin-Level Function Disruptions

 Windows offers a Run as administrator option that allows users to run applications and programs with administrator privileges. You can also use it to troubleshoot computer issues. But what if this feature malfunctions, depriving you of administrator rights?

 That’s where this guide comes into play. So, let’s look at what you can do to fix Run as administrator not working on Windows.

## What Causes Run as Administrator Not Working?

 Before you start fixing things, you must understand what causes this issue. In general, you may experience Run as administrator not working due to the following reasons:

* Group Policy or User Account Control (UAC) blocks the application or program you’re trying to run.
* The user account associated with your device isn’t an administrator account and therefore doesn’t have the necessary privileges.
* Corrupt system files or registry entries could prevent you from running administrator programs.
* Malware infection on your computer could disrupt the feature.

 Now that you know the potential causes of this issue, let’s look at ways to fix it. ​​​

## 2\. Check Your Account Type

 Not all user accounts are equal. To run programs with administrative privileges, you must have an administrator account. So, [head to the Control Panel](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-control-panel/) and [check your account type](https://www.makeuseof.com/check-windows-account-admin-rights/). If it’s not labeled as an administrator account, switch to a different one or create a new account.

## 3\. Check User Account Control Settings

 The Windows User Account Control (UAC) prevents malicious programs from installing on your computer. This security feature can stop you from using elevated privileges.

 To ensure the issue isn’t related to UAC, head to the Control Panel and check your User Account Settings. If it is set to the highest level, bring it down to the default. Here's how to do it:

1. Press **Win + S** simultaneously to open the search box.
2. Type **Control Panel** in the search box and press Enter. This will open the Control Panel window.
3. View items by **Large icons** in the Control Panel and click on **User Accounts**.
4. In the right pane, click on **Change User Account Control settings**. Doing this will open the User Account Control Settings window.
5. Here you’ll see a slider with four options: **Always notify**, **Default**, **Notify me only when applications try to make changes to my computer**, and **Never notify**.  
![User Account Control Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/user-account-control-settings.jpg)
6. Drag the slider to **Default**, then click **OK**. It will set your UAC to the default level and enable you to run applications with elevated privileges.

 Now, close the window and restart your PC. After that, try running the application with the Run as administrator feature and see if it works.

## 4\. Change Group Policy Settings

 Is the Run as administrator function not working despite trying the suggestions above? It's likely that group policy settings block the feature. To fix this, head to the Local Group Policy Editor and check the settings.

 Here’s what you need to do:

1. Press **Win + R** simultaneously to open the Run dialogue box.
2. Type **gpedit.msc** in the text field and press **Enter**. This will open the Local Group Policy Editor window on your computer screen.
3. From the left navigation panel, go to the following path:  
Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options
4. In the right pane, you'll see a list of different security options. Scroll to the bottom and double-click on the **User Account Control: Run all administrators in Admin Approval Mode** policy.

6. Close the Local Group Policy Editor and restart your computer.

 After restarting, try running a program with elevated privileges. It should work now. Don't forget to re-enable the Admin Approval Mode setting once you're finished troubleshooting.

## 5\. Clean up the Context Menu

 When you right-click on a program or file, you often see the Run as administrator option in the context menu. If it's missing, you should look at your context menu entries for clutter.

 This solution involves editing the Windows registry. A single mistake can cause serious problems. So proceed cautiously and [create a registry backup](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) before applying any changes.

 Follow these steps to clean up the context menu:

1. Press **Win + R** on your keyboard to open the Run command.
2. Type **regedit** in the text field and press Enter. Doing this will open the Windows Registry Editor.
3. If the UAC window pops up, click **Yes** to grant administrative privileges.
4. In the Registry Editor window, navigate to the following path:  
Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers
5. Next, expand the **ContextMenuHandlers** folder and look for any suspicious entries. If you find any, delete them.  
![Clean the Context Menu Items](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clean-the-context-menu-items.jpg)
6. Now exit the Registry Editor and restart your computer.

 Once your computer reboots, you will see the Run as administrator option in the context menu. Try running a program with elevated privileges and see if it works.

## 6\. Try Some Generic Fixes

 Besides the fixes mentioned above, some generic solutions work in any situation. Try these out if you’re still having issues running applications with elevated privileges:
