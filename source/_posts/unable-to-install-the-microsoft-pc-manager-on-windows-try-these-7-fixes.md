## 2\. Temporarily Disable Your Antivirus

 Most antivirus programs come with a security feature that stops installing malicious applications onto the computer. Unfortunately, they can sometimes block trusted applications like the Microsoft PC Manager. If this is the case with you as well, consider disabling the antivirus program temporarily as a solution.

 If you're using the Windows Security app as the default security program on your computer, here's how to disable it:

1. Open the Settings menu by pressing the**Win + I** hotkeys.
2. Select**Privacy & security** from the left panel.
3. In the Security section, select the**Windows Security** option.
4. Click the**Open Windows Security** button.
5. In the Windows Security app, click the**Virus & threat protection** option in the left panel.
6. Click**Manage settings** under Virus & threat protection settings.
7. Disable the toggle next**Real-time protection.**

 If you're using a third-party antivirus program, you can disable it by right-clicking on its icon in the system tray and choosing the "Disable" option from the context menu. You can also go through the antivirus support pages to learn more about how to disable it.

 After disabling the security program, give a quick restart to your computer and check if the problem continues.

 If running the built-in troubleshooter wasn't helpful, download and run the Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter from [Windows Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed-cca7d1b6-65a9-3d98-426b-e9f927e1eb4d) .

## 5 . Download Any Available Windows Updates

 Windows regularly releases updates to add new features and fix bugs and glitches. And from what it looks like, Microsoft PC Manager can fail to install on your computer due to a temporary glitch.

 To download any available Windows update, follow the below instructions:

1. Open the Settings menu and select**Windows Update** from the left panel.
2. Click the**Check for updates** option.  
![The Check for updates button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-check-for-updates-option.jpg)

<a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1567905/13846" target="_top" id="1567905"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1567905" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1567905/13846" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Windows will now look for and download any available updates. Once the update is installed, restart your computer and check for the issue.

## 6\. Fix Any Corrupted Files on Your Computer

 Another reason behind this issue is corruption within the system files. Fortunately, you can detect and fix these files by running an SFC scan. However, before we run the SFC scan, it is best to do a preliminary scan to ensure that the SFC tool is working properly.

 The Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool (DISM) is an integrated Windows utility that offers a wide range of functionalities. In this case, the DISM Restorehealth command makes sure that our next fix will work properly. Work through the below steps:

1. Open the Start menu, type**Command** **Prompt** in the search bar, and select the**Run** **as administrator** option. It'll open Command Prompt with admin rights.
2. In the elevated Command Prompt window, type**DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth** and press**Enter** .
3. Wait until the command is executed. Depending on your computer's health, the process can take up to 15 minutes. Sometimes the process will stick, but wait for it to complete.
4. After the process is complete, type**sfc /scannow** and press**Enter** .

## 7\. Reset Your Computer

![Reset PC button in Settings menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Reset-PC-.jpg)

 If you're still unable to install the Microsoft PC Manager, you can use the Windows Reset function. This will reinstall Windows, but it will keep all your personal files intact. Here's how to do it:

1. Navigate to Settings > System > Recovery.
2. Select the**Reset PC** button.

Next, follow the on-screen to complete the reset process.
