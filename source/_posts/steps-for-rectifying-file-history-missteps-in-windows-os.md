## Steps for Rectifying File History Missteps in Windows OS

 File History is a nifty feature on Windows that allows you to back up your important files and folders to an external drive. Although the feature works as expected most of the time, it can occasionally trouble you with errors like the “We found errors in your File History settings” on Windows.

 Let’s see how you can resolve this error and get the File History feature to work again on Windows.

## 1\. Restart the File History Service

 File History Service is a small program that needs to be running in the background for the File History feature to work. If this service is experiencing any problems, you could run into the "We found errors in your File History settings" error. In most cases, you can fix any temporary issues with File History Service by simply restarting it.

1. Right-click on the**Start icon** and select**Run** from the resulting menu.
2. Type**services.msc** in the text box and press**Enter** .
3. In the Services windows, scroll down to locate**File History Service** . Right-click on it and select**Restart** . If the service is not running, select**Start** .
