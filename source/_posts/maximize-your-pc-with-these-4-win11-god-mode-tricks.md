## What Is God Mode on Windows 11?

 The Windows 11 God Mode is a hidden feature that allows you to quickly access many settings in just a single click. You can think of God Mode as a folder containing the shortcut to each setting, so you never have to use the Control Panel or the Settings app ever again.

 Fortunately, God Mode makes it easy to configure your PC’s sound. Once you’ve created the God Mode folder, double-click to open it and scroll to find the**Sound** group. You can adjust the volume settings for different connected devices, change the default system sounds, and even manage the sound card configured to your PC.

## 2\. Use God Mode to Change System Settings

 The Windows 11 Settings app has a dedicated section for System related configurations. These include allowing remote access to your PC, updating the workgroup name, managing user profiles, etc. However, the Settings app is not always easy to navigate.

 Within the God Mode folder, you can scroll to the**System** section to view all related options. It’s quite easy to change the size of virtual memory, update system variables, personalize your Windows PC, and more with just a click.
