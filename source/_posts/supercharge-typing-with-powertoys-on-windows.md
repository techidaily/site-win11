## What Is PowerToys? How Can You Get It?

 Developed by Microsoft in collaboration with its community, PowerToys is a suite of open-source utilities you can install on your Windows 10 or 11 PC. With PowerToys, you can customize your Windows experience and enhance your productivity and efficiency.

 PowerToys was launched with Windows 95 and included a utility that enabled users to auto-play CDs. Today, PowerToys comprises many innovative tools, including one that lets you[extract text from images](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-powertoys-extract-text-images/) and another that[converts your cursor into a handy color picker](https://www.makeuseof.com/powertoys-color-picker-guide/) .

 It's easy to get PowerToys on your PC—look it up in the Microsoft Store and install it or download it from its[PowerToys Microsoft Store page](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-powertoys/XP89DCGQ3K6VLD) .

 Once you have PowerToys, you can use the Keyboard Manager, Quick Accent, and Shortcut Guide to type faster. Remember that PowerToys must be activated and running in the background for these utilities to work.

## How to Remap Keys and Shortcuts With the Keyboard Manager

 The Keyboard Manager lets you remap keys and shortcuts on your keyboard with the keys you are most comfortable typing with.

### How to Remap Keys to Type Faster

To remap your keys with Keyboard Manager:

1. Open PowerToys on your PC by searching for it on**Windows Search** and clicking**PowerToys** under**Best match** . Or double-click the**PowerToys icon** in the system tray. The**PowerToys Settings** screen will open up.
2. Click on**Keyboard Manager** on the left pane. Then**Enable Keyboard Manager** by turning its toggle on in the right pane.
3. Click on**Remap a key** to open the**Remap keys** window.  
![Keyboard Manager Settings in PowerToys](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/keyboard-manager-settings-powertoys.jpg)
4. Press the**down arrow** under the**Type** button in the**Physical Key** section, and select a key like**P** . Then under the**Mapped to** section, click on the**down arrow** under**Type** and select a key like**S** to map the physical key.  
![P Key Remapped to Key S in Remap Keys Window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/remap-keyp-to-keys.jpg)
5. Finally, click on the blue**OK** button on top and click on**Continue Anyway** on the warning prompt. Now when you type P on your keyboard, the letter S will get typed.

 Remapping a key is also handy if a key stops functioning. You can map it to another key till you get the faulty key fixed or buy a new keyboard.

 You can also map shortcuts like Ctrl + I to a key. Click on the**plus sign** under**Physical Key.** Then click on the**Type** button. Next, select a key like**F1** by pressing it on the keyboard. Then click**OK** .

 Now under the**Mapped to** section, click on the**Type** button. Now press**Ctrl + I** or the Italicize shortcut on the keyboard to map the**F1** key to it.

![F1 Key Remapped to Ctrl + I Shortcut](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/remap-key-to-shortcut.jpg)

 Now, when you need to italicize a text, instead of Ctrl + I, just press a single key, F1\. So you'll automatically be typing faster.

 This way, you could remap many alphabet and number keys, and even function keys to speed up your work. Think of all the milliseconds and seconds you will save whenever you type.

### How to Remap Shortcuts to Type Faster

 Below the**Remap a key** option you'll find the**Remap a shortcut** option. Click on it to open**Remap shortcuts** window. You can remap common shortcuts to other shortcuts you prefer to use.

 For example, instead of pressing**Ctrl + B** keys to make a text bold, you'd rather use**Shift (left) + Z** —Shift (left) + Z keys are next to each other and easier and faster to press together. So in the**Remap Shortcuts** window, type**Shift (left) + Z** under**Physical Shortcut** and**Ctrl + B** under the**Mapped to** section.

 You can choose**All Apps** as the Target App or an app such as**Word** , where you want this remapped shortcut to work. But remember to put the executable name or**EXE name** of the Word app, which is**Winword** . You can easily find the EXE names of apps via a Google search.

## How to Type Accents in a Snap With Quick Accent
