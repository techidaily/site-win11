You can then [rename the tab](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/network-locked-sim-card-inserted-on-your-xiaomi-14-ultra-phone-unlock-it-now-by-drfone-android/) with your pet's name.

Plus, if you wanted to combine data, most fitness trackers let you export your data as a [CSV file](https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-from-followers-to-fans-a-guide-to-thriving-instagram-presence/) or other file type that you can easily [import into Excel](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-establishing-a-mac-based-sports-media-outlet/).
