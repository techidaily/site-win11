## 4 Cool Things You Can Do With Windows 11 God Mode

 Some people find that Windows 11 is sleek, easy to use, and provides an incredible user experience overall. However, in spite of Microsoft's best efforts to improve the Windows 11 Settings app, navigating to an advanced system setting can be complicated.

 Considering Microsoft’s plans to gradually retire the classic Control Panel, it’s really important to be able to access advanced Windows 11 configurations in just a few clicks. Fortunately, today we’re going to dive into the secret Windows 11 God Mode that makes PC configurations easy as pie.

## What Is God Mode on Windows 11?

 The Windows 11 God Mode is a hidden feature that allows you to quickly access many settings in just a single click. You can think of God Mode as a folder containing the shortcut to each setting, so you never have to use the Control Panel or the Settings app ever again.

 This guide is for getting the absolute best experience possible from God Mode. If you need help enabling it, check out[how to enable God Mode on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/enable-god-mode-windows-11/) for instructions.

## 1\. Adjust Sound Settings Using God Mode

 Having the right sound setup is essential for your work meetings, watching a movie, or maybe even just playing some music. It can be difficult to navigate between the Control Panel and the Settings app just to adjust the sound on your PC.

 Fortunately, God Mode makes it easy to configure your PC’s sound. Once you’ve created the God Mode folder, double-click to open it and scroll to find the**Sound** group. You can adjust the volume settings for different connected devices, change the default system sounds, and even manage the sound card configured to your PC.

## 2\. Use God Mode to Change System Settings

 The Windows 11 Settings app has a dedicated section for System related configurations. These include allowing remote access to your PC, updating the workgroup name, managing user profiles, etc. However, the Settings app is not always easy to navigate.

 Within the God Mode folder, you can scroll to the**System** section to view all related options. It’s quite easy to change the size of virtual memory, update system variables, personalize your Windows PC, and more with just a click.

 Moreover, you can learn about your PC’s RAM and processor specs using the**Show how much RAM is on this computer** and**Check processor speed** options.

## 3\. Fix Common Windows 11 Bugs and Issues

 Your PC will inevitably run into some problems and when you do, it's important to be able to fix those issues right away. You can troubleshoot all sorts of sounds, network, printing, searching, and bluescreen issues using the**Troubleshooting** section of God Mode.

 Using the different available troubleshooting options will definitely help you quickly diagnose and fix issues with your Windows 11 PC.

## 4\. Configure Advanced Windows 11 Settings

 If you’re someone who often tinkers with advanced Windows settings such as defragmenting your drives, formatting disk partitions, or even setting up ODBC data sources, you’re going to really benefit from the**Windows Tools** settings group in the Windows 11 God Mode.
