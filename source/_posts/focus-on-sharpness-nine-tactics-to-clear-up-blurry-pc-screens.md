## How to Fix Blurry Screen Issues on Windows 11

 Here are the following methods you can try to remove the blurry screen issue on your Windows 11 system.

### 1\. Restart Your System

 Before trying out any major troubleshooting method, restart your system. Restarting your computer can fix common issues with services and background programs. Press**Alt + F4** and select the**Restart** option from the list. After the computer restarts, launch any program and check if the blurriness issue is still there.

### 2\. Tweak the Display Resolution and Scaling

 Lower screen resolution settings can make the screen element look grainy. However, low scaling settings on a high-resolution display can make matters even worse. So, you need to adjust these two display settings.

 To adjust the display resolution and scaling on Windows 11, do as follows:

1. Press**Win + R** to[open the Run command box](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) . Type**ms-settings:display** and press the**Enter** key.
2. Click on the**Display Resolution** option and set it to the resolution Windows recommends for your display.
3. **Apply** the resolution and if the blur is still noticeable, click on the**Scale** option.

4. If the recommended scale settings look very small and unreadable, pick the higher scaling percentage option from the list.

### 3\. Enable ClearType Text

 Microsoft bundles the ClearType technology which reduces the visible pixelation in fonts. If you experience blurry screen elements including text, you can use ClearType Text Tuner to fix the issue.

To enable ClearType Text on Windows 11, repeat the following steps:

1. Press**Win + S** and type**ClearType** . Click on the**Adjust ClearType text** option in the search results.
2. Click on the**Turn on ClearType** checkbox. Then click on the**Next** button.
3. Pick the text sample that looks the best on your display and click on the**Next** button.

5. Lastly, click on the**Finish** button to apply the new text rendering settings.

2. Navigate to**System > Display > Graphics** .

### 5\. Switch to the Best Appearance Settings

 Windows offers three visual effects modes. If you use the "Best Performance" mode, it removes all visual effects and the result looks washed out and grainy. However, switching to the "Best Appearance" mode can offer the best possible visual experience and remove blur.

 Repeat the following steps to apply the best appearance settings on your system:

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run dialog box. Type**sysdm.cpl** and press the enter key to open the System Properties utility.
2. Navigate to the**Performance** section and click on the**Settings** button.
3. Select the**Adjust for best appearance** radio button. Click on the**Apply** button.

4. Finally, click on the**OK** button and exit the System Properties window.

### 6\. Adjust App DPI Settings

 Another method to remove blurry text on Windows is using the Program DPI settings. If an app or program doesn’t automatically scale up to the default settings, you can override the high DPI scaling to improve the clarity and text sharpness.

Retrace the following steps to adjust the app DPI settings:

1. Press**Win + E** to[launch the File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) and navigate to the program executable file location.
2. Click on the program icon and then press**Alt + Enter** to open the Properties window.
3. Switch to the**Compatibility** tab and click on the**Change high DPI settings** button.
4. Now, click on the **Use this setting to fix scaling problems for this program instead of the one in Settings** checkbox.
5. Next, enable the**Override high DPI scaling behavior** checkbox as well.

5. **Restart** your system and run an app to check if the screen elements appear sharp or not.

 Device Manager isn't the best for finding new drivers, so if the above trick doesn't work out, check out[how to update AMD graphics cards](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-amd-graphics-card-drivers-windows/) or[how to update Nvidia graphics cards](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-update-nvidia-graphics-card-drivers-windows/) , depending on your GPU's model.

### 8\. Roll Back the Latest Windows Update

 If the blurry screen issue appears after a recent Windows update, you can try rolling back to the previous version. New updates can have bugs that wreck your system's performance.

Here’s how to roll back a recent Windows update:

1. Press**Win + R** to launch the Run command box.
2. Type**appwiz.cpl** and press the enter key to launch the**Programs and Features** utility.
3. Click on the**View installed updates** option.
4. Scroll down and locate the most recent update installation.
5. Then, click on the**Uninstall** button and follow the onscreen prompts to remove the update from your system.

### 9\. Use System Restore or Reset Your PC

 System Restore lets you roll back Windows to a previous state. If you encounter a screen blur issue after a recent program installation or update, you can use system restore to roll back to a state where things worked better. However, your system needs to have existing restore points saved to use this feature.

 If you don’t see any restore points available in the System Restore utility, then resetting Windows 11 is your last resort. Ensure that you back up all your data or use the in-place upgrade to keep all your files intact.

 You can check out how to do both of these in our guide on[how to factory reset Windows or use System Restore](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/system-restore-factory-reset-work-windows-10/) .

## A Blurry Windows 11 Blur Issue, Fixed
