2. In the**System** tab, click on**Notifications** .
3. Enable the toggle next to**Notifications** .

## 2\. Check In-App Notification Settings

 The Phone Link app allows you to choose which notifications from your phone appear on your PC. You need to review Phone Link’s in-app settings and ensure that notifications for calls, messages, or other apps are not disabled.

## 3\. Allow Phone Link App to Run in the Background

 On Windows, you can block specific apps from running in the background and using system resources. If you have previously restricted the Phone Link app from working in the background, it will fail to sync notifications. As a result, you won't receive any notifications for calls, messages, or other app alerts.

 To fix this, you must allow background app permissions for the Phone Link app. Here's how to do it.

1. Right-click on the**Start icon** and select**Settings** from the list.
2. Select**Apps** from the left sidebar.
3. Click on**Installed apps** .
4. Scroll down or use the search bar at the top to locate the**Phone Link** app on the list.
5. Click the**three-dot menu icon** next to the app and select**Advanced options** .
6. Click the drop-down menu under**Background apps permissions** and choose**Always** .

## 4\. Disable Battery Saver Mode

 Enabling the battery-saver mode on Windows can extend the battery life of your laptop by a few extra hours. However, this feature can also prevent apps like Phone Link from syncing data and displaying notifications. To avoid such issues, it’s best to disable the battery-saver mode on Windows.

 You can easily disable the battery-saver mode via the Quick Settings panel. However, if the icon is not visible, follow these steps to turn off battery saver mode.

1. Use one of[the many ways to open the Settings app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) .
2. Navigate to**System > Power & battery** .
3. Click on**Battery saver** to expand it.

![Turn Off Battery Saver in Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/turn-off-battery-saver-in-windows.jpg)

 It's worth noting that Windows might activate the battery saver mode automatically if the battery level falls below 20 percent. To prevent this, keep your laptop connected to a power source while using the Phone Link app.

## 5\. Disable Do Not Disturb Mode

 If Do Not Disturb is active on your Windows computer, you won’t receive notifications from any apps or programs, including Phone Link. Hence, it's best to turn off Do Not Disturb on Windows.

To disable the Do Not Disturb mode, use these steps:

1. Open the**Start menu** and click the**gear-shaped icon** to launch the Settings app.
2. Navigate to**System > Notifications** .
3. Turn off the toggle next to**Do not distrub** .
4. Expand the**Turn on do not disturb automatically** and clear all the checkboxes.
