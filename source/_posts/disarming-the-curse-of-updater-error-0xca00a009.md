## 5\. Clear the SoftwareDistribution Folder

 Software Distribution stores temporary files that may be required to run Windows Updates. And when these files become corrupted, these types of errors may occur. In this case, you can clear the contents of the folder and see if it works.

To clear the SoftwareDistribution folder, follow these steps:

1. Open Command Prompt with Administrative Privileges.
2. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt and hit Enter after each one:  
`net stop wuauserv  
net stop bits  
net stop cryptSvc  
net stop msiserver`
3. After executing the above commands,[open Windows File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) and browse to "C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\."
4. Inside the SoftwareDistribution folder, press**Ctrl + A** to select all the contents and tap Delete on your keyboard.
5. If you are asked to grant permission via a pop-up menu, click on**Continue** to proceed.
6. When you have deleted the contents of the SoftwareDistribution folder, you will need to restart any services that were stopped earlier. To accomplish this, open the elevated command prompt again and run the following command:  
`net start wuauserv  
net start bits  
net start cryptSvc  
net start msiserver`
7. Now type exit and press Enter to close the Command Prompt window.

 When you have completed all of the above steps, restart your computer and try updating Windows again after you've completed all the steps.

## 6\. Perform a Clean Boot

 This problem may also occur when a startup program or service conflicts with Windows Update. In this case, you should perform a clean boot as explained below:

1. Open the Run dialog box.
2. Type "msconfig" in the text field and click**OK** to open the System Configuration window.
3. In the System Configuration window, select the**General** tab.
4. Check the box next to**Selective startup** .
5. Uncheck the**Load startup items** box.  
![Perform-a-Clean-Boot-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Perform-a-Clean-Boot-1.jpg)
6. Switch to the**Services** tab now.
7. Select**Hide all Microsoft services** , then click**Disable all** .  
![Hide all Microsoft services](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hide-all-Microsoft-services.jpg)
8. Click**Apply** to save the changes.
9. Go to the**Startup** tab and select**Open Task Manager** . This will take you to the Startup tab in Task Manager.
10. Right-click each service on the**Startup** tab, and disable them.
11. Click**OK** when you're done editing System Configuration.

 Be sure to restart your computer after completing the above steps and follow up with updating Windows. If you find that this method solves your problem, you must have disabled the wrong service. To figure out which service is causing the error, enable them one by one.
