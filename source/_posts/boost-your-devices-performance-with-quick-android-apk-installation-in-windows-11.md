## Boost Your Device's Performance with Quick Android APK Installation in Windows 11

 You've set up the Windows Subsystem for Android, and you're ready to start installing those APK files. Turns out, it's a bit of a process. Wouldn't it be better if we could just double-click those APK files?

 Let's have a look at how to set it so that it works exactly like that.

 WSA-QuickInstall is what we'll use to achieve a more seamless APK install process. This simple app is found on [the WSA-QuickInstall GitHub page](https://github.com/officialnochill/WSA-QUICKINSTALL) . All you need to do is extract it somewhere you'll remember, and you're ready to move on.

 WSA-QuickInstall can be falsely identified as a threat by Windows Defender. You may need to [add an exception to Windows Defender](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-security-exclusions/) in order to use the app.

 Setting up WSA-QuickInstall is easy. Once extracted, you'll have two files and a folder. Keep them all together, but pay attention to**install.exe** , as this will be the executable that we use to actually sideload and install the apps.

 To make sure WSA-QuickInstall is working correctly, drag any APK file you have onto install.exe.

 A command prompt window may appear for a time, and then your system will install the app.

 That's all good and well, but how do we enable the seamless double-click install functionality?

## How to Set Up the Default Program for APK Files

 First, make sure you have an APK file handy to install. Then, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on your APK file and click**properties**
2. In the properties window, click**Change** located next to the**Opens with:** section
3. In the next window, hit**More apps**
4. Then scroll to the bottom and click**Look for another app on this PC**
5. Navigate to where you extracted the files and click**install.exe**

 It's as easy as that. Now, whenever you double-click on an APK file, Windows will automatically install it for you, hassle-free.
