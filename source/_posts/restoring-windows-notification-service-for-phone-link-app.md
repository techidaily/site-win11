## Restoring Windows Notification Service for Phone Link App

 Connecting your phone with your Windows PC via Phone Link allows you to stay on top of notifications you receive on your phone. This eliminates the need to check your phone every time it buzzes. While that’s useful, there can be times when the Phone Link app notifications stop working.

 To help out, we’ve compiled a list of solutions that will let you fix the Phone Link app notifications in no time.

## 1\. Enable Notifications for the Phone Link App

 Phone Link, like any other app, requires your permission to display notifications on Windows. If you have previously denied this permission to the Phone Link app, here's how to enable it.

1. Press**Win + I** to open the Settings app.
2. In the**System** tab, click on**Notifications** .
3. Enable the toggle next to**Notifications** .
4. Scroll down to the**Notifications from apps and other senders** section and select the**Phone Link** app.
5. Enable the toggle under**Notifications** .
6. Check the boxes that read**Show notification banners** and**Show notifications in notification center** .

## 2\. Check In-App Notification Settings

 The Phone Link app allows you to choose which notifications from your phone appear on your PC. You need to review Phone Link’s in-app settings and ensure that notifications for calls, messages, or other apps are not disabled.

 To check Phone Link’s in-app notification settings, use these steps:

1. Open the Phone Link app on your PC using the search menu.
2. Click the**gear icon** in the top right corner to visit the settings menu.
3. Switch to the**Features** tab.
4. Under**Notifications** , enable all the toggles.

## 3\. Allow Phone Link App to Run in the Background

 On Windows, you can block specific apps from running in the background and using system resources. If you have previously restricted the Phone Link app from working in the background, it will fail to sync notifications. As a result, you won't receive any notifications for calls, messages, or other app alerts.

 To fix this, you must allow background app permissions for the Phone Link app. Here's how to do it.

1. Right-click on the**Start icon** and select**Settings** from the list.
2. Select**Apps** from the left sidebar.
3. Click on**Installed apps** .
4. Scroll down or use the search bar at the top to locate the**Phone Link** app on the list.
5. Click the**three-dot menu icon** next to the app and select**Advanced options** .
6. Click the drop-down menu under**Background apps permissions** and choose**Always** .

## 4\. Disable Battery Saver Mode

 Enabling the battery-saver mode on Windows can extend the battery life of your laptop by a few extra hours. However, this feature can also prevent apps like Phone Link from syncing data and displaying notifications. To avoid such issues, it’s best to disable the battery-saver mode on Windows.

 You can easily disable the battery-saver mode via the Quick Settings panel. However, if the icon is not visible, follow these steps to turn off battery saver mode.

1. Use one of[the many ways to open the Settings app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) .
2. Navigate to**System > Power & battery** .
3. Click on**Battery saver** to expand it.
4. Click the**Turn off now** button.  
![Turn Off Battery Saver in Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/turn-off-battery-saver-in-windows.jpg)

 It's worth noting that Windows might activate the battery saver mode automatically if the battery level falls below 20 percent. To prevent this, keep your laptop connected to a power source while using the Phone Link app.

## 5\. Disable Do Not Disturb Mode

 If Do Not Disturb is active on your Windows computer, you won’t receive notifications from any apps or programs, including Phone Link. Hence, it's best to turn off Do Not Disturb on Windows.

To disable the Do Not Disturb mode, use these steps:

1. Open the**Start menu** and click the**gear-shaped icon** to launch the Settings app.
2. Navigate to**System > Notifications** .
3. Turn off the toggle next to**Do not distrub** .
4. Expand the**Turn on do not disturb automatically** and clear all the checkboxes.

 Phone Link may fail to display any notifications on Windows if your Android or iPhone isn’t linked properly. To avoid issues caused by misconfigured setup, you can unlink your phone from Windows and start over. Here are the steps for the same.

1. Open the Phone Link app on your PC.
2. Click the**gear icon** in the top right corner to visit the settings menu.
