## How to Install Windows 11 in VMware Workstation 17 Player

 Have you ever tried installing Windows 11 on VMware Workstation Player? It is not as easy as you expect from a Windows OS installation. Microsoft imposed the TPM requirement and secure boot for installing Windows 11\. Fortunately, Oracle introduced TPM virtualization in October 2022 and VMware also caught up sometime later.

 As such, you don’t have to rely on registry hacks to disable the TPM and secure boot requirements while installing Windows 11\. This post will guide you to create a virtual machine and install Windows 11 on it.

## The Prerequisites for Installing Windows 11 on VMware

 Here’s what you will need to install Windows 11 with TPM support in VMware Workstation 17 Player:

1. A Windows 11 ISO image file. Check our detailed guide on[how to download the Windows 11 ISO file](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-iso-direct-download/) .
2. A Windows 10 or above operating system with TPM 2.0 and virtualization support.
3. The latest version of VMware Workstation 17 Player must be pre-installed on the host system.
4. Adequate computing resources to run Windows 11 as a virtual machine. The list includes 64 GB disk space, 4 GB RAM, and a dual-core x64 processor.

 Once you have the necessary ISO file and the latest copy of VMware on your system, you can proceed to the virtual machine creation and Windows 11 installation.
