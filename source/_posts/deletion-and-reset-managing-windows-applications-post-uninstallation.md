 So how do you reset an app on Windows? Here’s what you need to know.

 You will find the button to reset the app in the**Reset** section of its advanced settings, and you should click it. Finally, confirm that this is what you want to do by clicking**Reset** in the pop-up as well.

## Windows Apps Just Need a Reset Sometimes

 If you don’t want the hassle of manually reinstalling an app, you can let Windows do it for you in the Settings app. Since this will be like installing a fresh copy of the app, be sure to reset it only when you’ve tried other ways to save the program.

 If you can’t reset an app in Settings, then you have to manually reinstall it.
