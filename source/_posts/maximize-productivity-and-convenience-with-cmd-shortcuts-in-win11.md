## Maximize Productivity and Convenience with Cmd Shortcuts in Win11

 The NirCmd software is a command-line tool you can utilize within the Command Prompt on any Windows platform. That software enables you to execute many commands that perform Windows tasks. Some of the NirCmd commands you can execute are very useful.

 However, it’s not ideal to manually input NirCmd commands to carry out Windows tasks. It’s much better to create Windows 11/10 desktop and hotkey shortcuts for activating the NirCmd tasks whenever needed. This is how you can set up several handy Windows command shortcuts with NirCmd.

## How to Set Up NirCmd Command Desktop Shortcuts

 You can set up NirCmd command shortcuts by creating Windows desktop shortcuts for them. Then you can assign hotkeys for activating the NirCmd commands to their Windows desktop shortcuts. However, first, you must download and extract the NirCmd command-line utility as follows:

1. Open this [NirCmd download webpage](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd2.html) in browser software.
2. Then scroll right to the bottom of that page and click the **Download\_NirCmd\_64-bit** link there.  
![The Download_NirCmd 64-bit link](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/download-nircmd-link.jpg)
3. Next, [open File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) and go to the directory where the NirCmd ZIP archive has been downloaded.
4. Follow the instructions in our [how-to unzip files](https://www.makeuseof.com/unzip-files-windows-10/) guide to extract the nircmd.zip archive. Extract the NirCmd folder to this user directory path:  
`C:\Users\nircmd-x64`

 Now that you’ve downloaded and extracted the NirCmd utility, you can set up desktop shortcuts for executing the commands below. These are the steps for creating a Windows desktop shortcut for a NirCmd command:

1. Click any area of your Windows desktop with the mouse’s right button and select the **New** and **Shortcut** options.  
![The Shortcut option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shortcut-option.jpg)
2. Then input (or copy and paste) one of the NirCmd commands below in the item location box as follows:  
`C:\Users\nircmd-x64\nircmd.exe NirCmd command`  
![The Create Shortcut window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/create-shortcut-wizard.jpg)
3. Click **Next** to continue to the final step in the shortcut wizard.
4. Input a suitable name for your NirCmd command shortcut and select **OK**.

 The item location box must include the full path of the extracted nircmd.exe file and one of the NirCmd commands specified below. You will need to modify the location specified above by replacing **NirCmd command** with an actual command. For example, you would need to input the following to create a desktop shortcut for the first NirCmd command specified below:

`C:\Users\nircmd-x64\nircmd.exe nircmd.exe emptybin`

 Of course, that desktop shortcut will only work if you extract NirCmd to the Users folder as instructed above. You can extract NirCmd anywhere you wish, but the full path of that software’s extracted file must be included in the item location box before the command. You can see the full path for the nircmd.exe file by right-clicking it and selecting **Properties**.

![A NirCmd file path](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/path-location.jpg)

 When you’ve created desktop shortcuts for the commands below, go ahead and try them out. Double-clicking the desktop shortcuts will execute the NirCmd commands they’re based on.

## How to Set Up NirCmd Command Keyboard Shortcuts

 It’s more convenient to have hotkeys for executing the NirCmd commands. You can create NirCmd command hotkeys for desktop shortcuts like this:

1. Right-click on a NirCmd desktop shortcut to select **Properties**.
2. Click in the Shortcut box and press a key combination to set up a **Ctrl** \+ **Alt** or **Ctrl** \+ **Shift** hotkey.  
![The Shortcut key box](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/the-shortcut-tab.jpg)
3. Then select **Apply** to save your hotkey.
4. Click **OK** to exit the shortcut’s properties window.

 Now press your keyboard shortcut to activate the NirCmd command desktop shortcut. However, don’t delete the NirCmd desktop shortcuts for which you’ve created hotkeys. The hotkeys won’t work without them.

 If you prefer not to clutter your desktop with shortcuts, you can move them into a subfolder. To do so, right-click the desktop to select **New** \> **Folder** and input a directory title. Drag and drop the shortcuts into the folder on the desktop.
