## Effective Conversion Strategies for Docx to PDF Using Windows 11

 You can open Microsoft Word’s DOCX files with many word processors, but they won’t always look the same across different software packages. Not all word processors support the same formatting as Word. Consequently, DOCX files can sometimes look a bit (maybe even very) different when viewed in other software, especially on non-Windows devices.

 Fortunately, you can convert DOCX files into the universal PDF file format will ensure they look the same for whomever you share documents with. PDF is a universal file format that preserves original formatting and page layout. This is how you can convert DOCX files to PDFs in Windows 11\.

2. Click **File** on the far left of Word’s tab bar.

7. Click **Publish** to save the converted Word PDF document. That PDF will then automatically open in the Edge browser, which all Windows users can view the file with.

Click on the **Save as type** drop-down menu to select PDF. Then select **Save** to finish.
