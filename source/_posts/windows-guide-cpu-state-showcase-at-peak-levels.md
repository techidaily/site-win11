## How to Show or Hide the Minimum or Maximum Processor State Using the Registry Editor

 You can also show or hide these options using the Registry Editor. However, before you do so, create a restore point as a backup in case you make a mistake and need to return your Windows computer to a previously-working state. Check out[how to create a restore point in Command Prompt](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-create-restore-point-command-prompt-powershell/) for more information.

 After creating the system restore point, press**Win + R** to open the Run dialog box. Then, enter**regedit** in the text box and hit the**Enter** key to open the Registry Editor.

![Regedit in Run](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/regedit-11-2.jpg)

 On the UAC prompt, click**Yes** to continue.

 To get to the key for the minimum processor state in the Registry editor, copy and paste the following file path into the Registry Editor’s address bar and hit**Enter** :

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power\PowerSettings\54533251-82be-4824-96c1-47b60b740d00\bc5038f7-23e0-4960-96da-33abaf5935ec`

## Add or Remove the Minimum and Maximum Processor States From Power Options

 Setting the minimum or maximum processor state on your Windows computer is vital to helping you get the performance you want from it. If you can’t see these options in the Power Options menu, you can easily reveal them with either Command Prompt or the Registry Editor. And after you’re done tweaking the states, you can hide them for their protection.
