## Turn Off Windows Mobility Settings Quick Guide (Win 11)

 Are you looking for a way to get rid of that pesky Windows Mobility Center in Windows 11? It can be quite annoying when your computer keeps popping up with all the different options like toggling Wi-Fi, adjusting volume and brightness, and more.

 In this article, we'll show you how to disable Windows Mobility Center through Group Policy or Registry changes.

## What Is the Windows Mobility Center?

 Windows Mobility Center is a feature that was introduced in Windows Vista to help people use their laptop or tablet computers with ease. It has a central location for quickly adjusting settings related to power, display, synchronization, and presentation. This accessible hub of options makes it easier to modify settings when switching between different scenarios such as working at home or in the office.

 Windows Mobility Center helps users easily adjust their laptop or tablet settings depending on their current environment. For example, if you're using your device at home you can turn up the brightness and enable wireless capabilities; if you're giving a presentation in a boardroom, you may want to switch off any notifications and mute audio output. With just one click of the mouse, Windows Mobility Center lets you make these changes quickly and easily.

## How to Disable Windows Mobility Center Using the Local Group Policy Editor

 Windows Mobility Center can be a great tool if you need quick access to some key settings, but it can also take up system resources and slow down your computer's performance.

 If you're looking to disable Windows Mobility Centre, you can do so by using the local editor group policy. However, it is important to note that the tool only works with Windows 11 Professional and Enterprise editions.

 In other words, if you use Windows Home edition, you won't have access to Local Group Policy. For this to work, you must first [activate the Group Policy Editor in Windows Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/) .

 To disable Windows Mobility Center using the Local Group Policy Editor, follow these steps:

1. Open the Local Group Policy Editor (see [how to open the Local Group Policy Editor](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/open-local-group-policy-editor-windows/) for more information).
2. Then navigate to the following path:  
Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Mobility Center
3. Select the**Windows Mobility Center** folder from the left pane, then double-click**Turn off Windows Mobility Center** .

4. In the pop-up dialog box, select**Enabled** .
5. When you have made the changes, click**Apply** and**OK** to save them.

 After completing the steps above, restart your computer to apply the changes.

## How to Disable Windows Mobility Center Using the Registry Editor

 Additionally, you can disable Windows Mobility Center through the Windows Registry. The process is fairly simple, but make sure you follow the instructions carefully. It's because even one mistake in the registry can lead to serious damage.

 If you decide to go this route, be sure to [back up your registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) . Here are the steps you need to follow in order to disable Windows Mobility Center:

1. Open the Registry Editor (see [how to open the Registry Editor](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-registry-editor/) to learn how).
2. Next, go to the following path:  
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies
3. On the right side of the window, right-click on the blank area.
4. From the context menu, select**New > DWORD (32-bit) Value** .

5. Upon creating the DWORD key, give it the name**MobilityCenter** and save it.
6. Now click twice on the key you just created, and a pop-up will appear.
7. Set the Value data to**1** with Hexadecimal as the base.
8. When you're done making these changes, click**OK** to save them.

 After completing the above steps, exit the Registry Editor and restart your computer.

## Disable Windows Mobility Center With Ease

 Windows Mobility Center provides quick access to various system settings related to laptops and mobile devices. While this is a useful feature, it might annoy you if your computer keeps popping up with options all the time. If so, you can disable it through the Registry Editor or Local Group Policy.
