## Dealing with Windows Update Failure - 0X800F0845

 Windows Update brings new features to your PC while installing important security updates and bug fixes. So it's vital to keep your system updated to work and play hassle-free on Windows.

 However, some unexpected errors occur, resulting in updates failing to install on your system. And 0x800f0845 is one such error.

 But you can get past the 0x800f0845 error and continue to install essential updates by trying the following fixes.

## What Is the Windows Update 0x800f0845 Error?

 0x800f0845 is an error that mostly occurs while installing cumulative updates on your Windows PC. You may experience this update error if Windows components and services are corrupted or if there are damaged or missing system files. Sometimes, this error happens by the interactions of third-party apps with the system apps.

 You may not come to know of the error while updating, as Windows will appear to be updating normally with messages of the updates installing—such as**Updates are underway. Please keep your computer on** .

 However, just before your PC reboots, the following message on your computer screen may appear: **Something didn't go as planned. No need to worry—undoing changes. Please keep your computer on** . This message indicates a problem with the update. When your computer restarts, the cumulative update would have failed to install.

 You can check for the same by going to**Settings > Windows Update** and then clicking**Update history** . In**Update history** , you will get the message that the cumulative update has failed to install with the error code**0x800f0845** like the screenshot below.

 So what can you do now? Cumulative updates are quality updates, so these must be installed. Fortunately, as there are ways to get past the 0x800f0845 error and install the failed updates.

## 1\. Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter

 It's always better to try fixing Windows update errors first by using the Windows Update Troubleshooter. It scans your PC for problems, attempts to resolve them, and then applies the fixes.

1. Right-click the**Windows icon** on the taskbar and select**Settings** . Or use the[many ways to open Settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) .
2. On the left pane in**Settings** , click**System** . On the**System** page, click**Troubleshoot** on the right pane.
3. In the**Troubleshoot** page, select**Other troubleshooters** .  
![Select Other Trouble-shooters in Troubleshoot Page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/troubleshoot-other-trouble-shooters.jpg)
4. Then click**Run** on the**Windows Update** troubleshooter.  
![Run Windows Update Troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/run-windows-update-troubleshooter.jpg)

 The Windows Update troubleshooter will automatically run its scans to diagnose problems. After troubleshooting completes, you'll get the message that changes have been made to your system and you should try attempting the tasks you were doing earlier.

 So close the troubleshooter and restart your computer. Then try updating Windows again and check if the failed update gets installed.

## 2\. Temporarily Disable Your Antivirus Software

 Sometimes, third-party antivirus installed on your PC may cause problems when you're updating Windows. So try temporarily disabling it and then installing updates.

 Your antivirus may have options to disable it temporarily. Or right-click on the Windows icon on the taskbar and select**Task Manager** .

 In**Task Manager** , click the**Startup** tab and look for your antivirus software. Then, right-click on it and choose**Disable** .

Try updating Windows now and see if the update gets installed.

## 3\. Run the System File Checker and the DISM Tool

 Corrupted Windows system files could also be the cause of the 0x800f0845 error. To scan, repair, and replace such damaged files, run the System File Checker or SFC scan.

 And if the SFC doesn't work properly, and can’t repair your system files, you should run the DISM or Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool. DISM is a command-line tool that can be used to service and repair Windows images, including those used for Windows Recovery and Windows Setup.

 To know how to run the SFC and DSIM, you can explore our guide on[CHKSDK, SFC, and DISM, and how they work](https://www.makeuseof.com/difference-between-chkdsk-sfc-and-dism-in-windows-10/) .

 These scans will take a few minutes to run. If the 0x800f0845 error was caused by corrupted files, it should have been fixed. So try updating Windows again.

## 4\. Reset Windows Update Components

`net stop bits  
net stop wuauserv  
net stop appidsvc  
net stop cryptsvc`

 Then to set up a new SoftwareDistribution folder, you need to rename it. So enter the following command and press**enter** :

`Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old`

 Next, rename the catroot2 folder for Windows to set up a new one. Type the following command and press**enter** :

`Ren %systemroot%\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old`

 Finally, you need to restart the stopped services. Type the following four commands one after the other, while pressing**enter** after each command:
