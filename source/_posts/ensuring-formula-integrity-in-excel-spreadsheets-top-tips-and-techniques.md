##  How Do You Lock the Cells Containing Formulas in Excel?

 By default, when you [protect your worksheet](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-essential-tips-for-gameplay-screen-captures-on-xbox-one-for-2024/), Excel locks all the cells in your sheet and not just the ones containing formulas. To get around that, you'll have to first unlock all your cells, select the cells containing formulas, and then lock these cells with formulas.

 This way, users can edit the values of all cells in your worksheet except for the ones that have formulas in them.

##  Lock a Formula Cell in Excel

 To avoid getting your formula cells altered, first, launch your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel.

 In your spreadsheet, select all cells by pressing Ctrl+A (Windows) or Command+A (Mac). Then right-click any one cell and choose "Format Cells."

![Choose "Format Cells" from the menu.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1-format-all-cells.png)

 The cells containing formulas in your worksheet are now locked. To prevent their modification, from Excel's ribbon at the top, select the "Review" tab.

 In the "Review" tab, click the "Protect Sheet" option.

![Select "Protect Sheet."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/7-protect-excel-sheet.png)

 You'll see a "Protect Sheet" box. Here, optionally, enter a password in the "Password to Unprotect Sheet" field. Then click "OK."

![Type the password and click "OK."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/8-enter-protection-password.png) 

 If you used a password in the previous step, then in the "Confirm Password" box that opens, re-enter that password and click "OK."

![Re-enter the password and click "OK."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/9-re-enter-protection-password.png) 

 And that's it. All the cells containing formulas in your worksheet are now locked. If you or someone else attempts to alter the contents of these cells, Excel will display an error message.

![Excel's error message for attempting to alter locked cells.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/10-excel-error-locked-cells.png) 

 Later, to allow users to edit these formula cells, then unprotect your worksheet by accessing the "Review" tab and choosing "Unprotect Sheet."

![Choose "Unprotect Sheet."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/11-unprotect-excel-sheet.png)
