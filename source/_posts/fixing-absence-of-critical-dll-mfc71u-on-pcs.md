### 3\. Perform an SFC Scan

 SFC is a system utility built into the Windows computer that helps you scan and check all your files, including DLL ones, for corruption. It then repairs any corruption as soon as it finds it. So, a quick SFC scan is an excellent way to fix your system files on Windows.

 Here's[how you run an SFC scan:](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/)

1. Head to the**Start menu** search bar, type in 'cmd,' and run your system as an elevated prompt.
2. In the cmd, type in the following command and hit**Enter** :  
sfc /scannow

![cmd](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cmd.jpg)

 The SFC tool will begin scanning your PC. Give it a few minutes, and the scan will be over in a few minutes. If your Mfc71u.dll error happened by corruption, a quick SFC scan should've sifted and cleared the error on your system.

### 4\. Perform a Factory Reset

 If you've toiled through all the methods from above but still have your PC paralyzed by the Mfc71u.dll error, then it's time to go for the final ace of all Windows troubleshooters: the factory reset.

 As its name suggests, a factory reset purges your computer of all its old system files and, if you like, the documents and other related files, and install a fresh copy of Windows. Think of it as restarting your operating system from a basic state; naturally, it resolves almost all PC problems quickly. Here's[how you can perform with a factory reset on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-ways-factory-reset-windows-computer/) :

* Press the**Windows Key + I** to open the settings menu.
* Head to**System > Recovery** .
* Select**Reset PC** .
* From the new dialog box, choose**Keep my files** . Don't worry; it'll help you keep all your Windows files, only reinstalling the operating system.
* Choose**Local** or**Cloud Install** .
* Click on**Next** .

 Finally, confirm to reset again. The factory reset process will kick off from here, and in no time, the setup will install a fresh copy of your Windows. The Mfc71u.dll error should be all but gone from here on.

## What About Downloading Mfc71u.dll From a DLL Website?

 Usually, the way to solve a missing file is to find it online and download it again. And yes, there are websites out there that allow you to download DLL files for Windows.

 However, doing so isn't such a great idea. The DLL file you download may be from a different version of Windows, which can cause system instability. On particularly shady websites, the DLL may even contain a virus. And if you're losing DLL files due to a specific system error or malware, re-downloading the file is a short-term solution for a long-term problem.

 As such, we don't recommend downloading Mfc71u.dll from a DLL website.
