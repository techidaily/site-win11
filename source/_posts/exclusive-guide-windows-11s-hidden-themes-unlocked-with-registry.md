## But First, a Warning About the Windows Registry

 While the following tips will let you unlock "secret" themes and tweaks via the Registry, it is by no means a place you should mess around in. The Windows Registry is very important for your PC's stability, and if you make adjustments to it outside of what we cover here, you run the risk of doing damage to it.

 As such, never tweak a Registry setting without proper care, and be sure to read[how not to mess up the Windows Registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/not-accidentally-mess-windows-registry/) to learn more.

## 1\. How to Get Windows 11's Secret Educational Themes

 If your PC runs Windows School Edition, you can[personalize Windows 11 with a theme](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-theme-guide/) exclusive for this version, as long as you've updated to Windows 11 22H2\. If you don’t use Windows 11 School Edition, you’ll have to work around the limitation.

 No matter which edition you’ve installed on your computer, you still need the 22H2 update. To check which version you’re currently using, launch Windows Settings and go to**Windows Update** .
