## Fast-Track Tips for Discovering Computer GPU Make

 The graphics processing unit (GPU) plays an integral part in your overall Windows experience, all the way from gaming to video editing. A high-performing graphic card can be a key deciding factor in your user experience.

 You may know all of the significant graphic card manufacturers, such as AMD, Nvidia, Intel, and ASUS... but what model is your GPU, exactly? Here's how to check your graphics card model on a Windows 11 PC.

## 1\. How to Check Your Graphics Card Model via Windows 11's Task Manager

 The Task Manager was redesigned in Windows 11 and now boasts a sleek interface that complements its functionality. While users typically use the Task Manager to keep track of running applications and services, you can also use it to figure out your graphic card model name and specs.

To check the installed graphics card or GPU of your Windows 11 PC:

1. Right-click the**Start** menu and select**Task Manager.**
2. From the side menu, choose**Performance** and then**GPU 0** . If you have more than one GPU installed, you’ll see them labeled**GPU 1, GPU 2** , etc. Alternatively, if you don’t know any**GPU** option, it's possible you may not have a graphics card on your system, or you may not have configured it correctly.

3. The Task Manager window will list the name of your graphics card in the top right corner. You can also find the**Driver** and**DirectX** versions in the bottom right corner.

## 2\. How to Find Your GPU Model Using DirectX on Windows 11

 You can use the DirectX Diagnostics Tool to get detailed specs of your PC. You can find system details such as the processor, total available RAM, BIOS version, GPU, sound, and even the details of input devices configured to your PC.

 To find the details of your Windows 11 GPU using the DirectX Diagnostics Tool:

1. Launch the**Start** menu, search for**dxdiag** , and select the**Best match** .

2. Select the**Display** tab to view details of your GPU, including the GPU manufacturer, chip type, dedicated display memory, etc. If you have more than one GPU on your PC, you will see multiple**Display** tabs with details of each GPU.

## 3\. How to Confirm Your Graphics Card Model via the Windows 11 Settings App

 While you may have used the Settings app to configure different aspects of your PC, you can also use it to view the specs of the graphic card installed in your system. You can also view other display settings, such as the screen resolution and display type.

 To check the advanced display settings of your Windows 11 PC, including GPU specs:

1. Launch the**Settings** app through the**Start** menu.
2. From the side menu, select**System** and then**Display** .
3. Under**Related settings** , select**Advanced display** .
