 The Microsoft Outlook preview app is available to[Microsoft 365](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-office-365-rename/) Insider program participants. Users who have signed up to be an ‘Insider’ are the first to receive the latest updates for their favorite Office apps. Microsoft relies on the feedback collected from the Insider community to improve features, fix bugs, and enhance user experience.

 You can visit the[official Microsoft 365 Insider website](https://insider.microsoft365.com/en-us/join/windows) to learn more about the Microsoft 365 Insider program.

 If you want to experience the Outlook preview app without signing up for the Insider program, you can do so through the official Windows Mail and Calendar apps.

## How to Switch to the Outlook Preview App via Microsoft Outlook

 If you have a valid Microsoft 365 subscription and are already part of the Insider program, you can switch to the Outlook preview app from the classic Outlook for Windows app. The Insider program is only available to users who either have a Microsoft 365 Family or Personal subscription.

 If you have a Business or Student subscription, your workplace administrator will have to register for the Insider program. I recommend joining the Insider**Current Channel (Preview)** rather than the**Beta Channel** , as it’s less prone to bugs and issues.

 Once you’ve registered your device and Microsoft account with the Microsoft 365 Insider program, you’ll be eligible for the latest updates to Microsoft 365 apps (this includes being eligible for the Outlook preview app).

To get the Outlook preview app through Outlook for Windows app:

1. Launch**Outlook** from the**Start** menu.
2. Add an email account if you haven’t already done so.
3. From the top-right corner, toggle the**Try the new Outlook** button.
4. Wait for Outlook to reload, and you’ll now have access to the all-new Outlook preview app.
