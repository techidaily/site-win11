## Reviving Post-Zestful Days of Life on Windows PCs

 As critically-acclaimed as it may be, High on Life released with performance issues almost as quirky as its humor. While the game generally runs well enough, users have reported instances of crashing.

 Let's have a look at possible causes and fixes for High on Life crashing on Windows 10 or 11.

## Why Is High on Life Crashing?

 High on Life runs on Unreal Engine 5\. While[Unreal Engine 5 will change the future of gaming](https://www.makeuseof.com/unreal-engine-5-change-gaming-reasons-why/) , it's also being prone to crashing on certain hardware or software configurations.

 Thankfully, it's mostly understood why these crashes are occurring and how we can possibly fix them.

## 1\. Check Your Hardware: How Many Sticks of RAM Do You Have?

 Users have reported that High on Life runs into issues if their system only has one stick of RAM.

 It doesn't matter if it's a large or small amount on that single stick, it seems High on Life is a little more prone to crashing on one stick rather than multiple.

 It's unknown what causes this error, or if it will be patched. Check our guide on[how to check your installed RAM](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-check-installed-ram-available-ram-slots/) if you're unsure.

## 2\. Verify High on Life's Local Game Files

 If you own the game on Steam, you're able to right-click on the title, click into**Properties** , and then**Local Files.** You can then run**Verify integrity of game files** to potentially fix any installation errors.

 If you own the game on the Epic Games Store, you'll need to right-click the game icon and hit**Manage** . From there, you can click**Verify** .

## 3\. Revert High on Life's Day One Patch

 High on Life received a day-one patch on consoles, though that same patch was delayed on PC. This means some users played the game without the day one patch, and only started to crash after it was applied.

 While there is a chance of additional patches further fixing crashing issues, you could downgrade the game to the original release version and see if playing without the patch helps. To do that, you'll need to[learn how to downgrade a Steam game](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-downgrade-steam-games/) .

## Getting High on Life Running Again

 Games running on Unreal can crash for any number of reasons, but the engine is versatile and, in most cases, easy to fix. With any luck, there will be further patches to improve the performance of this game.
