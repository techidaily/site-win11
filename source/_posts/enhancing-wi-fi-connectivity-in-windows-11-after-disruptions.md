## Enhancing Wi-Fi Connectivity in Windows 11 After Disruptions

 A common network issue that Windows 11 users face, is the "Windows can't connect to this network" error. This error can be quite frustrating, as Windows doesn’t give you any instructions on how to fix it. Sometimes, you just have to update the network driver or run the network troubleshooter.

 However, the solution might be a bit more complicated, but there's no need don’t worry. We’ll walk you through a complete troubleshooting process to get rid of the “Windows can’t connect to this network” error.

## 1\. Connect to the Network Using Another Device

 There’s a chance there’s nothing wrong with your Windows 11 computer, but you get the “Windows can’t connect to this network” error due to a network-related issue. To test it, try to connect to the same network using a different device. If you run into the same error, you’ll have to solve your network issues.

 If you can connect to the same network on a different device, go through the troubleshooting tips below.

## 2\. Manage the Network Drivers on Windows 11

 In many cases, connection issues such as the "Windows can't connect to this network" error can be resolved by updating your PC's network drivers. However, if you recently updated the drivers and the error appeared soon afterward, you should roll back the drivers to the previous version until the new ones are fixed. You can also try reinstalling the drivers to see if that fixes the problem.

 All these actions can be performed by accessing the Device Manager, so let's dive in and try some fixes.

### 1\. Update Network Drivers

To update your network drivers, perform the following:

![Update network driver in Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/update-driver-1.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

1. Right-click the**Start** button and select**Device Manager** .
2. In the Device Manager window, expand the**Network adapters** section.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Roll Back the Network Drivers

 If the issue started after you installed a new network driver, here's how to go back to the drivers you had before:

![Roll back driver version in Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/driver-properties-1.jpg)

1. Open Device Manager.
2. Expand the**Network adapters** section.
3. Right-click on the network driver and select**Properties** .
4. In the Properties window, go to the**Driver** tab.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Uninstall the Network Drivers

 If you want to do a fresh install, first download your network drivers from your manufacturer's website. It's a good idea to do this first before you uninstall your current network drivers; once they're gone, you won't be able to connect to the internet through that network adapter until you reinstall its drivers again.

 Once you have your new drivers ready, it's time to scrub away the old one:

![Uninstall network driver](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/uninstall-driver-1.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

1. Open Device Manager.
2. Again, expand the**Network adapters** section.
3. Right-click the network driver.
4. Click on**Uninstall device** .
5. Check the**Attempt to remove the driver for this device** option.
6. Click on**Uninstall** .
7. When you reboot your PC, Windows will automatically reinstall the driver.

 If this method didn't work, there are [other ways to uninstall drivers in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-uninstall-drivers/) .

## 3\. Check for Windows Updates

 Microsoft constantly releases updates to fix any bugs and glitches you may encounter while using your computer. If you’re using an older Windows version, you might miss the updates designed to keep your computer running smoothly.

 To update Windows to the latest version, press**Windows key + I** to bring up the**Settings** menu. Then, click**Windows Updates > Check for updates** .

 Windows will search for any updates and install them automatically. Once the process is complete, try to connect to the network.

## 4\. Disable IPv6

 IPv6 is really not needed for most connections unless explicitly specified by your router or ISP. So, you should disable it and try connecting to the wireless network again.

Here is how you can disable IPv6 on your computer:

![Network connection properties in Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ipv-6.jpg)

1. Locate the network icon on the System Tray.
2. Right-click on the icon and choose**Network and Internet settings** .
3. Click on**Advanced network settings** .
4. Under Related settings, choose**More network adapter options** .
5. Right-click on the wireless network, then choose**Properties** . Ensure you have admin privileges.
6. Uncheck the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) option.
7. Click**OK** .
8. Reconnect to the wireless network again.

## 5\. Disable and Enable the Wireless Network Adapter

 Sometimes, an easy reset of the wireless network adapter can fix connection issues on Windows. You can do this using the Advanced network options in Windows 11:

![Disable wireless connection in Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/disable-connection-1.jpg)

1. Right-click on the Network icon located in the System Tray.
2. Click on**Network and Internet settings** .
3. Click on**Advanced network settings** .
4. On the next window, choose**More network adapter options** .
5. Now, right-click the wireless adapter and click on**Disable** .
6. Wait for a moment, then right-click the wireless adapter and choose**Enable** .
7. Reboot your PC and try reconnecting to the network.

## 6\. Release the IP and Flush the DNS Cashe in Command Prompt

 The "Windows can't connect to this network" error can be due to an IP error. To fix this, you'll need to release the IP and flush the DNS cache.

 This may sound complex, but all you need to do is run a few commands in the Windows Command Prompt, and Windows will handle the rest. Here's how to do that:

![Flush the DNS cache](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/network-reset-command-1.jpg)

1. Type**cmd** in Windows Search.
2. Right-click on**Command Prompt > Run as administrator** .
3. In the Command Prompt console, type the following commands and press**Enter** after each one:  
   * netsh winsock reset  
   * netsh int ip reset  
   * ipconfig /release  
   * ipconfig /renew  
   * ipconfig /flushdns
4. Close Command Prompt and reboot your computer to see if the error is still there.

## 7\. Reset Windows' Network Configuration

 One of the most common culprits of the "Windows cannot connect to this network" error is an improper network configuration. An easy way to fix this is to simply reset your PC's network settings to the factory default.

 Fortunately, Windows allows you to reset all its network settings with a single option:

![Network settings in Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/network-reset-1.jpg)

1. Right-click on the**Start** button and head to**Settings** .
2. Click on the**Network & internet** option on the navigation bar towards the left.
3. In the next window, choose**Advanced network settings** .
4. Under More settings, click on**Network reset** .
5. Click on**Reset now** .
6. Your PC will reboot.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 8\. Turn Airplane Mode On and Off

 This quick trick might be enough to solve your network issues. By turning on Airplane mode, you instruct Windows to completely disconnect from all networks. This allows you to re-establish a stable connection once you disable Airplane mode.

 Open Windows Action Center and click on the Airplane mode tile. Wait a couple of minutes and turn it off. Then, try to reconnect to your network.

 If Airplane Mode is missing from Action Center, there are other ways to enable and disable it.

## 9\. Use the Network Troubleshooter

 Windows 11 has an in-built troubleshooter to detect and fix network issues. It may be worth a try to see if the utility can detect and fix the issue causing the "Windows can't connect to this network" error.

To run the Windows Network Troubleshooter, follow these steps:

![Run network troubleshooter in Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/run-troubleshooter-1.jpg)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068407/7443" target="_top" id="2068407"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068407" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068407/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

1. In Windows Search, type**network troubleshooter** .
2. From the search results, click on the**Find and fix network problems** option.
3. Click on**Next** in the troubleshooter.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 10\. Forget and Reconnect the Wi-Fi Network

 If you get the network connectivity error when trying to connect to certain networks, you should have Windows forget them.

![Forget wi-fi networks](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/forget-wi-fi-network-1.jpg)

 Here’s how you can manage every network that you have connected to:

1. Open Windows Settings.
2. Go to**Network & internet > Wi-Fi** .
3. Select**Manage known networks** .
4. Click the**Forget** button next to the network that you can’t connect to.
5. Now, reconnect to the Wi-Fi. You will have to re-enter the password.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 11\. Restart or Reset the Router

 Sometimes your router gets a little stuck and requires a reboot to sort itself out again. As such, giving your router a quick reset is a good way to quickly and easily [fix an unstable Wi-Fi connection](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-slow-unstable-wi-fi-connection/) .

 The method for resetting a router will vary depending on what model router you own. However, there is usually a physical power button on the router itself that you can use to turn it off and on again. If not, you can also access the router's configuration page and reboot it from there.

 Failing that, you can try restoring the router to factory defaults, either via a button on the router or on its configuration page. However, you'll have to reconfigure the router after resetting it.

## 12\. Use an Ethernet Cable

 If you’ve tried anything on the list without any success, and you don’t have time to go through more time-consuming solutions such as installing a big Windows update or loading a restore point, there’s one quick fix. Connect to the network using an [Ethernet cable](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-an-ethernet-cable/) .

 Not only will it fix the issue, but Ethernet cables are more reliable and will offer better speeds.
