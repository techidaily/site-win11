## Supercharge Windows-Based Counter-Strike Play

 Despite its age, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is still one of Windows's best first shooter games. But like any other multiplayer game, it experiences low FPS issues. And a low frame rate makes it almost impossible to enjoy the game at all.

 Whether the latest update isn't running smoothly on the PC, or you suddenly find Counter-Strike struggling to offer better frame rates, we're here to help. Here are some tips to boost FPS in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

## What Causes a Low FPS in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive?

 A low FPS issue is common on a system that doesn't feature the latest graphics driver update. However, this isn't the only cause of the problem. Below are the major reasons for the low FPS in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive:

1. If the system isn't capable of the applied in-game settings, you'll get a low FPS in Counter-Strike.
2. Different background running applications that constantly consume the system resources can cause framerate issues.
3. You will experience a low FPS in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive if there's any corruption in the game files.

 Now that you know the possible reasons behind the problem, here are the solutions you can try.

## 1\. Update the Graphics Driver

 Running the game on an outdated graphics driver can ruin the gaming experience. An updated graphics driver ensures you get a reliable FPS in the game.

 Depending on the graphics driver the system features, you can download the latest update by visiting the [NVIDIA driver page](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/) or [AMD driver page](https://www.amd.com/en/support). If the system runs on integrated graphics, consider using the [Intel driver update tool](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/intel-driver-support-assistant.html).

 Instead of downloading updates via the manual method, always use manufacturers' software utilities to get the job done. Not only do they make updating the drivers a cakewalk, but they also suggest additional tweaks and features.

## 2\. Close Any Unnecessary Background Applications

 When playing multiplayer titles like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, it's good to close all the unnecessary background applications. Doing this will free up resources that the system can allocate to the game.

 You can do this easily with the help of the Task Manager. Below are the exact steps you need to follow.

1. Open the **Task Manager** usingone of the [many ways to open Task Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-open-task-manager-windows-10/).
2. In the Processes tab, right-click on all the applications you no longer need and choose **End task** from the context menu.  
![End Task option in Task-Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Task-Manager-1.jpg)

 Relaunch the game and check whether you are getting a comparatively better FPS or not.

## 3\. Adjust Your PC's Power Options

 Windows lets you change the power settings on your computer. By default, this setting is set to "balanced," which ensures that you get an equally good battery and system performance. But sometimes, especially on laptops, the balanced mode can decrease gaming performance.

 As a solution, consider switching to WIndows' high-performance power mode. You can do that by following these steps:

1. Open **Settings** using the **Win + I** hotkey.
2. Navigate to **System** \> **Power & Battery**.
3. Click on the drop-down icon next to **Power mode** and choose **Best performance** from the context menu.

 The above settings will consume more battery. So, if you are using a laptop, make sure it is connected to a power supply before you start gaming.

## 4\. Change Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's In-Game Settings

 High in-game graphical settings are a prime reason behind Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's low FPS issues. The more you push your PC past its breaking point, the worse framerates you get.

 To get a better FPS in the game, try lowering the graphics settings and other related options. Below are some changes you can make to get a better FPS in CS:GO.

* **Display Mode** \- Fullscreen
* **Laptop Power Saving** \- Disabled
* **Global Shadow Texture** \- Very Low
* **Model / Texture Details** \- Low
* **Effect Details** \- Low

* **Shader Detail** \- Low
* **Multicore Rendering** \- Enabled
* **Multisampling Anti-Aliasing Mode** \- None
* **Texture Filtering Mode** \- Bilinear
* **FXAA Anti-Aliasing** \- Disabled
* **Wait for Vertical Sync** \-Disabled
* **Motion Blur** \- Disabled

 After making all these changes, reboot the game and check if there is any improvement in the FPS or not.

## 5\. Turn Off the Windows Game Bar

 Windows comes with a built-in Game Bar feature via which you can record gameplay, take screenshots, and more. And while it is extremely helpful for capturing in-game moments, it can also negatively impact your gaming performance.

 So, if you're not using it, consider disabling the Game Bar to avoid any potential interference. You can do it by following the below steps.

1. Open the Settings menu.
2. Head towards **Gaming** \> **Xbox Game Bar**.
3. Disable the toggle next to the **Enable Xbox Game bar** slider.

 Try playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive again and see if your FPS has improved.

## 6\. Enable Windows' Gaming Mode

![The Game Mode option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/game-mode-option.jpg)

 Windows 10 and 11 both come with a dedicated gaming mode that prioritizes the gaming experience. This feature helps in achieving better FPS and stable gameplay. It also ensures that Windows won't start downloading updates while you game.

 Here are the steps to enable gaming mode on Windows PC.

1. Open **Settings** \> **Gaming** \> **Game Mode**.
2. Enable the toggle next to **Game Mode**.

 Now that Game Mode is active, you should notice a performance boost.

## 7\. Repair Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's Files

![Checking for corruption in CSGO game files](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Verify-Integrity-of-Game-Files-CSGO.jpg)

 If you are getting low FPS only in CS:GO, there is probably something wrong with the game files. As it turns out, if the game files get corrupted, it can cause different issues, including a low FPS.

 As CS:GO is officially available on Steam, you can use its handy file integrity checker tool on the game. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Open **Steam.**
2. Go to **Library** and right-click on **Counter-Strike: Global Offensive**.
3. Choose **Properties** from the context menu.
4. Select **Local Files** from the left pane.
5. Click on **Verify integrity of game files.**

## 8\. Customize Your NVIDIA Control Panel Settings

 The NVIDIA Control Panel is the primary application for fine-tuning your NVIDIA GPU settings. By customizing various graphics settings, you can increase FPS in CS:GO.

 Here's how to access the NVIDIA Control Panel and adjust its settings to fix the low FPS issue in CS:GO:

1. Open the Start Menu, type **NVIDIA Control Panel** in the search bar, and press **Enter**.
2. Choose **Manage** **3D settings** from the left sidebar and **Global** **Settings** from the right pane.
3. Change the **Low** **Latency Mode** to **Ultra**. This setting allows the CPU to send frames more quickly to the GPU, reducing input lag and boosting FPS.  
![Ultra option for Low Latency Mode](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ultra-option.jpg)
4. Choose **Unlimited** from the **Shader** **Cache** **Size** drop-down menu. The shader cache stores graphics instructions like lighting, elements, and textures in the GPU. By setting this option to unlimited, you can reduce the time required for graphics processing, ultimately fixing the CS:GO low FPS issue.  
![Unlimited option for Shader Cache Size](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/unlimited-option.jpg)
5. Select **Prefer** **maximum** **performance** from the **Power** **management** mode drop-down menu.
6. Click the **Apply** button.

 It's essential to note that these changes may impact different systems differently based on their hardware configuration. While some systems may see a drastic increase in FPS, others might experience the opposite effect. Therefore, carefully monitor each setting and revert them if they reduce FPS instead of increasing it.

## 9\. Overclock Your Computer's GPU

 If you are still facing issues, it's a strong indicator that you need to upgrade your system. But if you don't have the money to go through the upgrade process, consider overclocking your system's components instead.

 Overclocking helps squeeze a bit more power from what you already have without you needing to spend anything. Although overclocking might sound dangerous, it can help breathe new life into an old system when done properly.

 Whether the latest update isn't running smoothly on the PC, or you suddenly find Counter-Strike struggling to offer better frame rates, we're here to help. Here are some tips to boost FPS in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
