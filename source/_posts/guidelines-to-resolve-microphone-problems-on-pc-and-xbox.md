## Guidelines to Resolve Microphone Problems on PC & Xbox

 Some users have posted in Microsoft’s help forum about fixing their microphones not working with the Xbox app in Windows 10 and 11\. Those users have said their microphones generally work ok with other apps but not with the Xbox app. Consequently, they can’t utilize their headset mics or other types of microphones for things like Xbox party chat.

 A microphone is an important device for the Xbox app. Is your microphone also not working with the Xbox app in Windows? If that’s the case, this is how you can fix your microphone not working in the Xbox app.

## 1\. Run the Windows Troubleshooter for Recording Audio

 The Recording Audio troubleshooter can be helpful for fixing many microphone-related issues in Windows. So, maybe it will help some users fix this Xbox app microphone issue. You can open the Recording Audio troubleshooter from the Control Panel in both Windows 11/10 like this:

1. Open Run (see[how to open Windows Run](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) for methods) and type in**Control Panel** in its**Open** box.
2. Select**OK** to open a Control Panel window.
3. If you’re in the category view, click**Large icons** on the**View by** menu.

7. Select**Next** to proceed to the list of devices to troubleshoot.
8. Choose a microphone to troubleshoot and click**Next** .
9. Select**Apply this fix** for troubleshooting suggestions.

## 2\. Connect a Headset Microphone with a Different PC Port

 To ensure a headset microphone or other mic device is connected properly, try plugging it into an alternative port. Are you using a headset microphone that supports USB and jack connections? If so, connect it with your PC’s jack port instead of the USB alternative.

## 3\. Check the Microphone Permission Settings for the Xbox App

 Windows has microphone permission settings that need to be enabled for the Xbox app to pick up sound. So, make sure microphone access is allowed for the Xbox app. This is how you can enable microphone access for the Xbox app on Windows:

1. To open Settings, press the**Windows** logo and**I** keyboard keys simultaneously. Check out[how to open Windows Settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) for more ways.
2. Click the**Privacy** Settings**category** or**tab** .
3. Select**Microphone** to view mic app options.  
![The Microphone navigation option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/microphone-navigation-option.jpg)
4. Turn on the**Microphone access** setting if necessary.
5. If**Let apps access your microphone is** disabled, turn on that setting.  
![The Let apps access your microphone setting](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/let-apps-access-microphone-setting.jpg)
6. Then scroll down and click the toggle switch for the Xbox app to turn on its mic access.

7. Restart Windows before opening the Xbox app to check if the issue persists.

## 4\. Change the Default Format Output Option

 Many users have confirmed that changing the default format for their microphone devices fixes the mic not working with the Xbox app. Those users switched the default format to a**DVD Quality** setting. You can select that default microphone output format in Windows like this:

1. Bring up Windows Search with**Win + S** .
2. Type**change system sounds** inside the search box.
3. Click**Change system sounds** to bring up a Sound window.
4. Then select the**Recording** tab to view sound input devices.
5. Right-click the input microphone you try to utilize with the Xbox app and select**Properties** .  
![The Uninstall device option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/device-manager-window.jpg)
6. Click**Advanced** in the properties window.
7. Then select the**2-channel, 16-bit, 48000 Hz (DVD Quality)** option in the drop-down menu.  
![The Default Format setting](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/default-format-setting.jpg)
8. Press**Apply** to save the new default format output setting.
9. Click**OK** to exit the**Advanced** tab and properties window.

## 5\. Select the Right Audio Input Device in the Xbox App

 Make sure your Xbox app’s sound settings are set right. The microphone you’re trying to use with that app should be selected on that app’s Input device menu. This is how you can set the audio input device within the Xbox app:

1. Start the Xbox app.
2. Click your user profile name in the top-left corner of the app’s window.
3. Select**Settings** to bring up a window.  
![The Settings menu option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/settings-menu-option.jpg)
4. Click**Audio** on the left of the Settings window.  
![The Audio tab](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-audio-tab.jpg)
5. Then select the microphone you want to use with the Xbox app in the Input device menu.

 If you set the**Default** input option, you’ll need to make sure you’re using your PC’s default microphone. To do that, go to the**Recording** tab as instructed in steps one to four of the previous resolution. Then select the microphone to utilize with the Xbox app there and click**Set Default** .

## 6\. Reset the Xbox App

 The Xbox app, like others, has a**Reset** troubleshooting option you can select in Settings. That option clears the app’s data to fix issues. You can select that option to apply this potential solution by following the instructions in our[how to reset apps on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-reset-app/) article.

## 7\. Reinstall the Driver for the Audio Input Device

 A faulty or corrupted audio input device driver is another potential cause for the microphone not working with the Xbox app. Though that would also probably cause issues with using the same microphone with other apps. In this scenario, reinstalling the driver for the audio input device could be a solution, and some users have confirmed that. Try reinstalling the driver for your Xbox app microphone like this:

1. Open Device Manager by pressing**Win + X** and selecting**Device Manager** .
2. Extend**Audio inputs and outputs** by double-clicking that category.
3. Right-click the microphone you need to utilize with the Xbox app and select**Uninstall** **device** .  
![The Uninstall device option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/device-manager-window.jpg)
4. Click**Uninstall** to confirm and remove the device.
5. Then reboot your Windows 11/10 PC for automatic driver reinstallation.

## 8\. Reinstall the Xbox App

 The last troubleshooting method for this microphone issue is to try reinstalling the Xbox app. The app you’re using might be an outdated version, or there could be other issues with it that only reinstallation will resolve. You can remove the Xbox app in Settings as outlined in method two in[how to uninstall Windows software](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/) .

![The Uninstall option for the Xbox app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-uninstall-option.jpg)

 After uninstalling the Xbox app, open its[Microsoft Store page](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/xbox/9MV0B5HZVK9Z) ; select the**Get in Store** **app** option to bring up the Microsoft Store; then click**Get** on the Xbox app page.
