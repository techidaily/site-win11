## Editing the Quick Settings Menu

 While the Quick Settings menu has a default set of icons, you don't have to settle. Instead, you can add or remove as many icons from the Quick Settings menu as you like, all with a few tweaks.

Here's how you can get started:

1. Click on the pencil icon below in your Quick Settings Menu.
2. To remove a pre-existing icon, click on the unpin icon of the respective icon.
3. To add a new icon to the menu, click on**Add** and select the icon you'd like to add to your menu.
4. Finally, click on**Done** , and your settings will be saved.

 A list of options that you will see on the Quick Settings menu include:

* Airplane mode
* Battery saver
* Night light
* Accessibility
* Nearby sharing
* Project
* Wired display

 Moreover, if you click on the settings icon, you'll see it as the settings menu. And, when you hover over it, you'll get taken straight to the settings menu of your Windows.

## Using Quick Settings on Windows PC

 You can exit the Quick Settings menu by clicking anywhere outside the settings menu. Although Quick Settings is limited in what it can do, it's the perfect solution for someone rushing. However, if you're looking for more control and functionality, your best bet would be to rely on the Control Panel or the Settings menu.
