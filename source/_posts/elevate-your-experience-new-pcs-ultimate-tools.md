 aText is a popular text expansion and automation app now available on Microsoft Store. If you type emails or documents with repetitive words, names, and signatures or use complex words frequently, you can use aText to assign abbreviations to individual or multiple words.

 The app features a default group consisting of pre-defined snippets. You can also add and create your own custom snippets. Next time you use the pre-defined or custom abbreviation in an email or text editor, it will automatically replace (autofill) it with the defined phrases.

 aText works on almost any modern text editor, including your browser and desktop apps. However, you may need to run aText with administrator privileges to provide permission to access apps with administrative rights on your PC.

**Download** :[aText](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/atext/9N68HC1SRR0K) (Free, premium version available for $29.99)

## 4\. WhatsApp Desktop

![whatsapp desktop](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/whatsapp-desktop.jpg)

 The desktop version works similarly to the web version but with additional features. For example, you can receive notifications even when WhatsApp Desktop is closed, or your phone is switched off.

 That said, the app does not support the View Once feature for media files. So, you’ll only be able to open these media files using your smartphone.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Files App is an alternative to Windows File Explorer. It is an excellent file manager utility offering just enough additional features to edge out the built-in file manager app on Windows.

 Files App features a multi-tab layout, which is now also part of File Explorer on Windows. However, Files App is more streamlined, looks clean, and offers additional features. For instance, you can enable dual pane view to work with multiple folders in the same tab side by side.

 The context menu is another impressive addition as it borrows Windows 11’s new design language but adds the necessary options missing in the latest iteration of the Windows OS. You can further personalize it with different themes and backgrounds. You can also set it as the default file manager. But look out for occasional crashes, which can become annoying in no time.

 If Files App doesn't end up becoming your favorite, try [the best Windows File Explorer alternatives](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-windows-file-explorer-replacements/) for something new.

## 7\. ShareX

This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a>

 The rudimentary screenshot utility in Windows lacks advanced features. If you need to capture scrolling screenshots, annotate, or edit captured screenshots, you’ll have to rely on third-party software.

 ShareX is a popular screenshot utility with a basic screen recording capability. It is a feature-rich program with support for multiple capture methods, after-capture options, and productivity tools.

 The built-in editor is as good as it can get for a screenshot utility. The Smart eraser tool color matches the objects to hide the selected region. You can further annotate the saved screenshot with text, arrows, and more.

 You can customize ShareX to save images automatically and even upload them to different cloud services. On the flip side, the app interface looks cramped due to the plethora of features available.

## 8\. Microsoft To Do

![microsoft to do](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/microsoft-to-do.jpg)

 Microsoft To Do is a popular list, tasks, and reminders app available on Windows and other platforms. It helps you get organized and keep track of your day’s tasks to be more productive.

 The user interface on the desktop version is text heavy yet familiar to the one available on the Android and iOS platforms. You can quickly add your task from the home screen and star items to mark them as important.

 Furthermore, you can add reminders based on date and time and set the task as repetitive. You can also create a new custom list or group, view completed and pending tasks, share task lists with others for collaboration and personalize them with colorful backgrounds.

## Not All the Best Windows Apps Are in the Microsoft Store... Yet

 With new and legacy apps making their way to the platform, Microsoft Store is slowly growing. However, the biggest improvement we have seen is that the store itself is more functional now and fails less frequently.

 However, it still doesn’t have some great third-party apps, such as WinAeroTweaker, Microsoft’s own Windows PC Manager, Rambox, etc., on its listing yet. Fortunately, you can easily get this app on the developer’s website and install them like any other third-party app on your Windows computer.
