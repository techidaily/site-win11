## Mastering Warhammer's Precision Gameplay - End Stuttering on Windows

 Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun launched to a lot of praise from its fans. Many would agree it's fun as well as light on visuals, so why does it have a problem with stuttering?

 Let's have a look at how to fix an annoying bug with Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun.

## What Causes Stuttering in Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun?

![screenshot of warhammer 40000 boltgun video settings menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot_of_warhammer_40000_boltgun_video_settings_meun.jpg)

 Boltgun uses a simple, retro art style. This means it's a very easy game to run and shouldn't be putting too much stress on your hardware.

 Yet stuttering may still occur. It can even occur on very powerful hardware that shouldn't have any problems running the game.

 If you've looked at [other ways to fix game stuttering on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-game-stutter-fix/) and nothing is working, it might be worth turning your attention to texture streaming. Disabling this option might be your best bet for a stable performance.

## How to Fix Stuttering in Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun

![screenshot of warhammer 40000 boltgun launch commands field](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot_of_warhammer_40000_boltgun_launch_commands_field.jpg)

 Disabling texture streaming is easy, though it's not an option available in the in-game settings menu.

 From the library page on Steam, **right-click** on the game and select **Properties.** In the **Launch options** field, paste the following command.

-notexturestreaming

 After adding this launch option, you should no longer experience any stuttering within the game.

## Why Does Disabling Texture Streaming Help?

 Texture streaming loads and unloads textures into your VRAM as you play. This is usually a beneficial optimization method and allows the game to run on lower-end hardware.

 However, if you have a modern graphics card, it's likely you have enough VRAM to load everything the game needs at once. Turning off texture streaming stops the game from loading content into your VRAM, and instead, loads it all at once.

 Without the need for the game to constantly load and unload textures, you can remove one of the bottlenecks that cause this stuttering issue.
