## How to Use the Mouse Without Borders and Peek Features in PowerToys

 PowerToys is constantly adding new features, making it a handy utility for users looking to get more out of Windows. It started with a bunch of utilities but now has the most comprehensive lineup of tools including Mouse utilities, Image Resizer, and many more.

 The new preview update introduces "Mouse Without Borders" and "Peek" utilities. We will elaborate on what these utilities do, and how you can enable and use them on your Windows PC. Let’s begin.

## What Is the “Mouse Without Borders” Feature?

 If you use multiple computers on your desk, you might have faced the issue of using your mouse on all the computers. While some [Bluetooth mice](https://www.makeuseof.com/improve-gaming-with-logitech-g-hub/) can cycle between devices, you can not use one mouse to control all the computers as if they were sharing the screen.

 The Mouse Without Borders feature makes it possible to share the mouse among multiple devices. Both computers will need the latest version of PowerToys installed on them. Earlier, Mouse Without Borders was a standalone app and competed with the likes of Share Mouse and other [mouse and keyboard sharing apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-apps-sharing-mouse-and-keyboard-across-computers/). But now it is a part of PowerToys, so you don’t need to install it separately.

 Mouse Without Borders also permits the two computers to share their clipboard. If you copy a file that is less than 100 MB in size, it will also be copied to the clipboard.

## What Is the "Peek" Feature?

 The “Peek” feature enables you to preview files without opening them within an app. You can preview the contents of the file, especially when it is a batch or registry file, and examine the code. There is also a specific utility to [edit and view registry files in PowerToys](https://www.makeuseof.com/registry-preview-feature-powertoys/). Apart from that, it can also preview images, PDFs, text files, and video files. Moreover, you get the option to them open the file with a compatible application.

## Easily Share Mouse and Preview Files With PowerToys

 Both these new features in PowerToys are excellent add-ons to an already great assortment of utilities. Mouse Without Borders used to be a standalone app and like Fancy Zones, it is also a part of PowerToys Now.

 The Peek feature is great when you don’t want to open the file directly. However, PowerToys introduced a Registry Preview feature which is similar to Peek but only works for viewing and editing Registry files.

 The new preview update introduces "Mouse Without Borders" and "Peek" utilities. We will elaborate on what these utilities do, and how you can enable and use them on your Windows PC. Let’s begin.
