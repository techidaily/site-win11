## Windows 11: Changing Picture Preview Size

 Have you ever had trouble identifying your images in Windows because their thumbnail size was too small? If so, you've come to the right place. In this article, we'll share two efficient ways to change the image thumbnail size, allowing you to easily organize and locate your files.

## 1\. Change Image Thumbnail Size Using the File Explorer

 Whether you need to perform simple tasks like viewing images or more complex operations like managing [Folder options](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-folder-options-guide/), the Windows File Explorer has you covered. And if you want to adjust image thumbnail sizes to your liking, you can do that too using File Explorer.

 Here's a step-by-step instruction on how to use File Explorer to change image thumbnail size:

1. Press the **Win** key to open the **Start Menu**.
2. In the search bar, type **File Explorer** and press Enter. Alternatively, you can press the **Win + E** hotkey to launch the File Explorer.
3. Head towards the target image folder.
4. Click the **View** option at the top and choose the image thumbnail size from the context menu. Windows offers four thumbnail sizes â€“ extra large, large, medium, and small. You can choose either of the thumbnail sizes as per your preference.

## 2\. Change the Image Thumbnail Size Using the Registry Editor

 The Registry Editor is a crucial Windows utility that allows you to configure various system settings. However, it's important to note that editing the registry can be risky, as one mistake could cause your system to become unstable. Therefore, it's essential to [back up the registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) and [create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) before proceeding with any changes.

 Once you've completed these prerequisites, follow the steps below to use the Registry Editor to change the image thumbnail size:

1. Open the Start Menu, type **Registry Editor**, and press Enter. If this method doesn't work, check out other [ways to launch the Registry Editor](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-registry-editor/).
2. In the Registry Editor, head toward the following location:  
`Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer`
3. Right-click the blank space in the right pane, hover the cursor to **New**, and select **DWORD (32-bit) Value**.

4. Name the value **ThumbnailSize**.
5. Double-click on ThumbnailSize, and enter the value between **32** and **256**. The higher the number, the larger the image thumbnail.

6. Click **OK** to save the changes.

## Everything Is Large and Clear on Windows

 Thumbnails are small representations of the original image, allowing you to identify and organize your images easily. However, if the image thumbnail size is too small, identifying and organizing your images can be challenging. Fortunately, the above methods can help you change the image thumbnail size according to your preference, making it easier to manage your files.
