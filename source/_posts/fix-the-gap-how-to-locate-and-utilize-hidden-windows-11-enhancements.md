## Fix the Gap: How to Locate & Utilize Hidden Windows 11 Enhancements

 The Enhancement tab in the audio device properties window can improve your system's sound quality. But for many users, the Enhancement tab goes missing after upgrading to Windows 11.

 As such, if you are also facing the same issue, we'll share a few different fixes you can try when the Enhancement tab is missing in Windows 11.

## Why Is the Enhancement Tab Missing in Windows 11?

 There are plenty of ways to[improve the audio and sound quality on a Windows 11 PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-improve-audio-quality/) , but the Enhancement tab has been around long before Windows 11 was even announced.

 The Enhancement tab is where you can configure sound settings like bass boost, virtual surround, loudness equalization, and more. However, if the Enhancement tab is not available on your Windows 11 PC, these can be the possible culprits behind it:

1. You are using an outdated audio driver, or there's corruption in the current driver update.
2. Important audio services are not running in the background.
3. A temporary glitch in the OS build you are using can also be the reason behind the issue.

 Having known all the possible culprits behind the problem, let's dive into solutions you can try in this situation.

## 1\. Download the Latest Windows Update

 Before getting into advanced troubleshooting, you must update Windows to eliminate the possibility of an outdated Windows causing the problem. To download the latest Windows update, open the**Settings menu** , and then choose**Windows Update** from the left panel.

 In the Windows Update section, click the**Check for updates** button to allow Windows to look for any available updates. If any update is found, it will be automatically downloaded and installed on your computer.

 Once the update process is complete, restart your computer and check for the issue.

## 2\. Use the Audio Troubleshooter

[Windows 11 offers various troubleshooters](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-troubleshooters/) that can come in handy in fixing different system issues. To eliminate sound issues, including the Enhancement tab missing problem, you can use the audio troubleshooter. Here's how to use it:

1. Open the Settings menu, and choose the**Troubleshoot** option in the**System** tab.
2. Select**Other troubleshooters.**
3. Click the**Run** button next to**Playing audio.**  
![Playing audio troubleshooter in the Settings menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/playing-audio-troubleshooter.jpg)
4. In the Troubleshooter window, select the audio device in which the Enhancement tab is missing, and click**Next.**

 The troubleshooter will scan the selected audio device and suggest fixes that will help you restore the Enhancement tab.

## 3\. Reinstall the Audio Driver

 Sometimes corruption in the current audio driver update can be the reason behind the problem at hand. The solution, in this case, is to reinstall the audio driver on your computer.

 To do this in a system featuring a Conexant SmartAudio driver, follow the below steps:

1. Launch the**Run dialog box** by pressing the**Win + R** hotkeys.
2. Type**Control Panel** in the Run dialog box and press**Enter** .
3. Once you're in the Control Panel, select**Programs** and then**Programs and Features.**
4. Look for and right-click on the Conexant SmartAudio program and choose**Uninstall** from the context menu.

 Now, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the uninstallation process. After that, restart your computer and check for the problem.

 If your computer has a Realtek audio driver, follow the below instructions to reinstall it:

1. Open the**Device Manager** (see[how to open the Device Manager on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-device-manager/) ), and double-click on the**Sound, video, and game controllers** node to expand it.
2. Right-click on**Realtek® Audio** and choose**Disable device.**  
![Disable device option in the Device Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/disable-device-option.jpg)
3. Click**Yes** to the confirmation box that crops up.
4. Right-click on the Realtek® Audio again and choose**Update driver.**
5. Choose the**Browse my computers for driver** option.
6. Select the **Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer** .
7. Check the**Show compatible hardware** box and choose the**High Definition Audio Device** option under the**Model** section.

8. Click**Next.**
9. Click**Yes** to the Update Driver Warning that appears.

 Windows will now install the driver on your computer. After the process is complete, reboot your computer and check if the Enhancement tab is back.

## 4\. Enable All Important Audio Services

![Start service option in the Services window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/start-service.jpg)

 The**Windows Audio** and**Windows Audio Endpoint Builder** are two important services that manage audio and all its related settings on Windows. If either of these services is disabled, your PC may run into audio issues, including a missing Enhancement tab.

 To ensure both these services are running, follow the below instructions:

1. Launch the**Start** **Menu** by pressing the**Win** key.
2. In the search bar, type**Services** and press Enter.
3. In the Services window, search for and right-click on the**Windows Audio** service.
4. Choose**Properties** from the context menu.
5. Check the**Service status.** If it says**Stopped,** then it means that the service is not running.
6. To enable the service, change the**Startup type** to**Automatic** and click the**Start** button under**Service** **status** .
7. Click**Apply** and then**OK** to save the changes.

 Similarly, check the Windows Audio Endpoint Builder service status. If it is also disabled, enable it by following the above steps.

## 5\. If All Else Fails, Reset Your Computer

![Reset this PC option in the Settings menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/reset-this-pc.jpg)

 If you have tried all the above fixes and still the Enhancement tab is missing, it might be best to cut your losses and reset your Windows 11 PC.

 There are[multiple ways to factory reset your Windows PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-ways-factory-reset-windows-computer/) . The**Keep my files** option can reinstall Windows without removing any of your personal files. You should still[back up your personal data to the cloud](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-windows-computer-cloud/) before doing this, though.

 To perform a reset, open the Settings menu, and choose**Recovery** in the System tab. Then, click the**Reset PC** button next to**Reset this PC** .

## The Enhancement Tab in Windows 11, Restored

 The unavailability of the Enhancement tab will cut you from configuring settings that will help you get better system sound. Hopefully, applying one or all of these solutions helped you restore the Enhancement app in Windows 11\. But if nothing worked, hold out for the next major Windows 11 release, which should hopefully fix the issue.
