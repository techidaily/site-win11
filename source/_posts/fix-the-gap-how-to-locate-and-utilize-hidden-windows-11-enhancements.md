## Fix the Gap: How to Locate & Utilize Hidden Windows 11 Enhancements

 The Enhancement tab in the audio device properties window can improve your system's sound quality. But for many users, the Enhancement tab goes missing after upgrading to Windows 11.

 As such, if you are also facing the same issue, we'll share a few different fixes you can try when the Enhancement tab is missing in Windows 11.

## Why Is the Enhancement Tab Missing in Windows 11?

 There are plenty of ways to [improve the audio and sound quality on a Windows 11 PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-improve-audio-quality/) , but the Enhancement tab has been around long before Windows 11 was even announced.

 The Enhancement tab is where you can configure sound settings like bass boost, virtual surround, loudness equalization, and more. However, if the Enhancement tab is not available on your Windows 11 PC, these can be the possible culprits behind it:

1. You are using an outdated audio driver, or there's corruption in the current driver update.
2. Important audio services are not running in the background.
3. A temporary glitch in the OS build you are using can also be the reason behind the issue.

 Having known all the possible culprits behind the problem, let's dive into solutions you can try in this situation.

4. In the Troubleshooter window, select the audio device in which the Enhancement tab is missing, and click**Next.**

 The troubleshooter will scan the selected audio device and suggest fixes that will help you restore the Enhancement tab.

## 3\. Reinstall the Audio Driver

1. Launch the**Run dialog box** by pressing the**Win + R** hotkeys.
2. Type**Control Panel** in the Run dialog box and press**Enter** .

 The**Windows Audio** and**Windows Audio Endpoint Builder** are two important services that manage audio and all its related settings on Windows. If either of these services is disabled, your PC may run into audio issues, including a missing Enhancement tab.

1. Launch the**Start** **Menu** by pressing the**Win** key.
2. In the search bar, type**Services** and press Enter.
3. In the Services window, search for and right-click on the**Windows Audio** service.

## 5\. If All Else Fails, Reset Your Computer

![Reset this PC option in the Settings menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/reset-this-pc.jpg)

 If you have tried all the above fixes and still the Enhancement tab is missing, it might be best to cut your losses and reset your Windows 11 PC.

 There are [multiple ways to factory reset your Windows PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-ways-factory-reset-windows-computer/) . The**Keep my files** option can reinstall Windows without removing any of your personal files. You should still [back up your personal data to the cloud](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-windows-computer-cloud/) before doing this, though.

 To perform a reset, open the Settings menu, and choose**Recovery** in the System tab. Then, click the**Reset PC** button next to**Reset this PC** .

## The Enhancement Tab in Windows 11, Restored

 The unavailability of the Enhancement tab will cut you from configuring settings that will help you get better system sound. Hopefully, applying one or all of these solutions helped you restore the Enhancement app in Windows 11\. But if nothing worked, hold out for the next major Windows 11 release, which should hopefully fix the issue.
