There are numerous ways you can feasibly resolve that Audacity recording/playback error in Windows. This is how you can fix the “error while opening sound device” issue.

## 7\. Update Your PC’s Audio Device Driver

 If none of the above possible fixes do the trick, try updating your PC’s sound driver. The issue could be arising because your PC’s sound driver is outdated or corrupted. Our guide on [updating audio drivers on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-audio-drivers-windows/) includes instructions for applying this potential solution.

## 8\. Reinstall Your PC’s Audio Driver

 Should you find your PC’s audio driver isn’t outdated, try reinstalling it instead. This is how you can reinstall the sound driver:

1. First, activate the Power User menu with its**Win + X** shortcut.
2. Select**Device Manager** to access that tool’s window.
3. Click the small arrow beside the**Sound, video and game controller** category.
4. Right-click High Definition Audio device to select an**Uninstall** context menu option.

![The Delete the driver software for this device option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/delete-the-driver-option.jpg)
7. Restarting Windows should then automatically reinstall a sound driver on your PC. If not, click**Action** \>**Scan for hardware changes** in Device Manager to reinstall the missing driver.

 There could also be an issue with the driver for the microphone you’re trying to utilize when Audacity’s recording isn’t working right. So, consider reinstalling the driver for the audio input device as well. You can do so by double-clicking the**Audio inputs and outputs** category and selecting to uninstall the microphone from there.

 Applying those potential resolutions will likely fix the “Error while opening sound device” issue in most cases. Then you can get back to recording/playing audio in Audacity. If those potential fixes aren't enough, there could be a hardware issue with your PC’s sound card or some of the audio devices you’re trying to utilize with Audacity.
