## The Art of Dynamic Walls in Windows 11 for Enhanced Aesthetics

 Live wallpapers are Windows desktop backgrounds that have motion. More basic live wallpapers are typically MP4 video or animated GIF files. A live wallpaper that moves looks more alive than static Windows background images.

 Windows doesn’t have any built-in option for setting videos, or any animated file format, to be live desktop wallpaper. However, Lively Wallpaper is one of numerous third-party apps with which you can add moving wallpapers to Windows 11’s desktop. This is how you can liven up the Windows 11 desktop with Lively Wallpaper.

## How to Add an Interactive Live Wallpaper From Lively Wallpaper’s Library

 Lively Wallpaper is an open-source UWP app that’s available on the Microsoft Store. This app enables you to add 12 premade live wallpapers to the desktop from its library and video files saved on your desktop. The live wallpapers available in this app’s library are a little different from standard videos because they add interactive backgrounds.

 As Lively Wallpaper is a UWP app, the installation required is quick and simple. To install the app, open this [Lively Wallpaper page](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/lively-wallpaper/9NTM2QC6QWS7) and click **Get in Store** \> **Open in Microsoft Store** to [bring up the Microsoft Store app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-microsoft-store/). Then select **Get** to download and install Lively Wallpaper. You can click **Open** on Lively Wallpaper’s MS Store page to launch the app.

 Now you’ll see 12 live wallpaper thumbnail previews on the Lively Wallpaper’s **Library** tab after opening the app. Click a live wallpaper thumbnail on that tab to set the background. The live wallpaper selected will then replace the one on your desktop.

 What sets these premade wallpapers apart from others is that they’re interactive. For example, select the **Fluids** background to see what it’s like. That wallpaper applies a stunning multi-colored fluid effect that reacts to the movement of your mouse cursor. You control the fluid effect by moving your cursor and windows across the desktop.

 Or you can add a jellyfish to your desktop’s background by selecting the Medusae wallpaper. That’s a jellyfish you can rotate by left-clicking on it and holding the mouse button.

 Some of the premade wallpapers have customization settings. To configure a live wallpaper, click its ellipses **…** button. Select the **Customize** button on the menu to bring up the settings for the wallpaper. Then you can adjust those settings to modify the wallpaper.

## How to Add Video Wallpapers to the Windows Desktop

 Would you prefer to have one of your own recorded videos on the Windows desktop? If so, you can add non-interactive video wallpapers saved on your PC to the Windows 11’s desktop background like this:

1. Press the **Plus** button in Lively Wallpaper.
2. Click **Open** to bring up a file selection window.
3. Select a video you want to add to the Windows 11 desktop.
4. Click **Open** to add the background.  
![The Open button for the Choose a file option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/choose-a-file-option.jpg)
5. Input a name for the live wallpaper in the **Title** box. You can also add additional details about the wallpaper in the **Description** box.  
![The Title and Description boxes](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/the-title-box.jpg)
6. Then click **OK** to set the video as the desktop wallpaper.

 Now you’ll see the video you’ve selected on the background of the Windows 11 desktop. Lively Wallpaper’s **Library** tab will also include that wallpaper and any others added. You can also remove live wallpapers added to the library by clicking their **ellipsis menu buttons** and selecting **Delete**.

 Lively Wallpaper’s customization settings for all videos added are the same. You can adjust the saturation, hue, brightness, speed, contrast, and gamma of video wallpaper by dragging the bar sliders within the customization panel. Select the **Mute** option to turn off unwanted video sounds without affecting the system volume.

 If you don’t have any suitable videos to add to the Windows desktop background, there are many websites you can download live wallpapers from. For example, Pixabay has an expansive collection of live wallpaper backgrounds (MP4 format) you can add to your desktop with Lively Wallpaper.

 You can download them from this [Pixabay live wallpaper page](https://pixabay.com/videos/search/live%20wallpaper/). Click a wallpaper you like and press its **Download** button to save it.

 You can also create some videos to add to the desktop background. The Photos app enables you to create videos from images. Or you can [set up new videos with the Clipchamp app](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-clipchamp-create-cool-videos/), which includes many templates for creating clips.

 Gaming fanatics can even add their greatest moments to the Windows 11 desktop by recording gameplay videos with the Game Bar app or other software. Check out this guide about [recording videos while gaming](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-record-video-while-gaming-on/) for further details about how to capture in-game clips.

1. Open a YouTube page that includes a video you want to watch.
2. Click the video’s play button.
3. Select the page’s URL in the website address bar with your cursor.
4. Press **Ctrl** \+ **C** to copy the website URL.
5. Then click the **Enter URL** box to expand it in Lively Wallpaper.

1. Press Lively Wallpaper’s **Plus** button.
2. Next, paste the YouTube web address into the **Enter URL** box by pressing **Ctrl** \+ **V** and clicking the **arrow button**.

![A YouTube video page on the Windows background](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/youtube-video-page.jpg)

 Now you’ll see the YouTube video playing on the Windows desktop. You can’t adjust any of the playback controls when the video is on the desktop. So, set all playback options within the video preview box before adding the YouTube page to your desktop.

## Configuring Lively Wallpaper’s Options

 Lively Wallpaper includes numerous options for configuring the app. To access them, click the **Settings** cog button to view the **General** tab. To permanently set live wallpaper, you must select the **Start with Windows** option on that tab, so Lively Wallpaper runs automatically at startup. If you don’t want to hear any live wallpaper sound, deselect the **Play audio when desktop is focused** option on the **General** tab.

 You can set a taskbar theme on the **System** settings tab. To do so, click the **Taskbar Theme** drop-down menu and select an option. For example, selecting **Clear** will make the taskbar completely transparent. Or you can select **Blur** for a blurred transparency effect.

 The **Wallpaper** tab includes options for adjusting appearance and behavior. You can select three different background fill options on the **Choose a fit** drop-down menu there. Or change the input device for interactive wallpaper by selecting a setting on the Wallpaper input drop-down menu.
