## 3\. Clean Up Your Disk Drive

 Your computer must have enough space to download and install the Windows updates. If this isn't the case, you will likely face different issues, including the update error 0x800f0922.

 The solution, in this case, is to[free up disk space in your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/6-tips-free-disk-space-windows-10/) . One way to do that is by cleaning the drive containing the Windows 11 OS, which is C: drive for most users.

 To clean the drive, you can use the Disk Cleanup tool, which removes redundant files to create more space. Here's how to use it:

1. In the Start menu, type**Disk Cleanup** and press Enter.
2. Click the drop-down icon, select the drive containing Windows 11 OS, and then click**OK.**
3. Click the**Clean up system files** button.

4. Under the**Files to delete** section, select the files you want to delete and click**OK.**  
![OK button in the Disk Cleanup](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ok-button.jpg)
5. Click the**Delete Files** option in the prompt that crops up.

 That's it. You have gained some space in the OS drive. If you want to create more space, you can remove unnecessary folders from the OS drive.

 For instance, you can[delete old Windows update files](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/delete-old-windows-update-files/) like the Windows.old folder, which contains data of the OS version previously installed on your computer. This folder is automatically created whenever you upgrade from Windows 10 to 11.

 There's no harm in deleting this folder, but make sure you only do it when you have no plans to return to Windows 10.

1. In the Start menu, type**Command Prompt** and choose**Run as administrator** from the right pane.
2. In the console, type these four separate commands and press Enter after each:  
`net stop bits  
net stop wuauserv  
net stop appidsvc  
net stop cryptsvc`
3. Type the following command and press Enter to rename the SoftwareDistribution folder:  
`Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old`
4. Then, execute this command to rename the catroot2 folder:  
`Ren %systemroot%\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old`
5. Now, to restart the services, execute these four commands separately:  
`net start bits  
net start wuauserv  
net start appidsvc
