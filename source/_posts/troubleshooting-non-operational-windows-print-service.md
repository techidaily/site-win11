## Troubleshooting Non-Operational Windows Print Service

 The Print Spooler is a little application built into your operating system. It allows you to send multiple print jobs to a queue without waiting for the initial print job to complete. If the print spooler service stops working, you’ll encounter the print spooler service is not running error on Windows.

 It is a common error associated with print jobs. However, the reasons for the error can vary. You may encounter this error when setting up a new printer, after installing an update, or upgrading your router. In any case, here are a few troubleshooting steps to help you resolve this error in Windows.

## How "The Print Spooler Service Is Not Running” Error Message Appears

 Here are the different types of print spooler errors you can encounter:

* "Windows cannot connect to the printer. The local print spooler service is not running."
* "Operation could not be completed. The print spooler service is not running."

 Whichever error you encounter, the solutions for fixing them are the same.

 Now create a new print job and check if the error is resolved. If not, disconnect and reconnect the printer to see if that helps.

 To disable Windows Defender Firewall:

1. Press **Win + I** to open **Settings**.
2. Open the **Privacy & security** tab in the left pane.
3. Next, click on **Windows Security.**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
8. With the Firewall disabled, create a new print job, and see if it completes successfully.
9. Once done, enable the **Windows Defender Firewall** protection.

 If you use your printer frequently, disabling Windows Defender Firewall is not a feasible solution. You’ll need to investigate the issue further to allow the connection through the Firewall.
