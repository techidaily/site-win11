## What Triggers the "No Server Found" Error in Apex Legends?

 One of the instances in which the error code can appear is when the game servers are currently facing downtime. But there are many more reasons that can be responsible for the issue. Let's check them out first before driving into the solutions.

1. Running the game without administrative rights is one of the most prominant reasons why Apex Legends can't find any servers.
2. Some outdated or corrupt network adapters can affect your connectivity and cause the problem at hand.
3. A corrupt DNS cache data is another reason Apex Legends cannot connect with the servers.

Now let's check out all the solutions in detail.

## 1\. Check the Apex Legends Server Status

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Like any other online multiplayer game, Apex Legends servers can face downtime. If the game is experiencing an outage or maintenance, you'll be unable to connect to them.

 So, whenever you face the problem at hand, first check the server status of the game. You can do this by visiting the[Apex Legends server-status checking webpage](https://apexlegendsstatus.com/) .

## 2\. Check Your Internet Connection

 Most of server connection-related issues in online multiplayer games often result from a weak internet connection. So, check the internet connection whenever you face the problem at hand. You can do it by visiting one of the[internet-speed checking websites](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-websites-test-internet-speed/) .

 If you are getting a comparatively lower speed, consider power cycling the router. If that doesn't help, contact your ISP.

## 3\. Run Apex Legends With Administrative Rights

 Running apps without administrative rights can cause issues, especially if the app requires an internet connection. So, ensure you are running Apex Legends as an administrator. Here's how.

1. Right-click on Apex Legends and choose**Properties.**
2. Switch to the**Compatibility** tab.
3. Checkmark**Run this program as an administrator** option.
4. Click on**Apply** \>**OK** .

Relaunch the game and check if you still face the problem.

## 4\. Switch to a Different Server

![Different servers of Apex Legends](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/different-servers.jpg)

 Another quick way to resolve the issue is to switch to a different server within your region. However, this fix will only be helpful if there's a regional server outage. If all the servers are down, then try the next solution.

 Also, be prepared to experience comparatively higher ping on the new server, but it's still better than waiting for the servers to become operational again.

## 5\. Verify Games Files

![Repair option in EA app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/repair.jpg)

 Games may start misbehaving and throw different errors if there's corruption in their files. Fortunately, you can quickly eliminate this issue by verifying the game files.

 When you verify game files, launchers will compare the game files on your computer with those on its servers. If it finds corruption in any file, it'll automatically replace it with its counterpart. Here's how to verify Apex Legends files in the EA app:

1. Launch the EA app on your computer.
2. Choose**Library** from the left sidebar.
3. Click the**three dots** on the Apex Legends icon and choose**Repair** from the menu that crops up.

 After completing the verification process, restart the EA app and check for the issue. If you're using any other launcher, check our guide on[verifying game files on different launchers](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-verify-game-file-integrity-different-launchers/) .

## 6\. Turn Off Any Proxy Server Connections

 A proxy server is useful for keeping yourself safe online. On the other hand, it can make some connections unstable and cause different issues, including Apex Legends' "no servers found" problem.

 Try turning off any active proxy server connections and check if it fixes the issue. Here's how to do it.

1. Open the**Start Menu** , type**Internet Options** , and press Enter.
2. Click on the**Connections** tab.
3. Choose**LAN settings** .
4. Uncheck**Use a proxy server for your LAN box** .  
![Turn off proxy on Internet Options](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Turn-off-proxy.jpg)
5. Click on**OK.**

 Try to connect with the game servers again and check if the problem is fixed.

## 9\. Switch to Google's DNS Server

2. Choose**Network & Internet** from the left pane.
3. Head towards**Wi-Fi > Hardware Properties** .
4. Click on**Edit** next to the**DNS server assignment** .  
![Wi-Fi properties screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DNS-server.jpg)
5. Click on the drop-down icon under**Edit DNS settings** , and choose**Manual** from the context menu.
6. As per your DNS provider, choose**IPv4** or**IPv6.**
7. If you choose**IPv4,** enter**8.8.8.8** and**8.8.4.4** in**Preferred** and**Alternate DNS servers,** respectively.
8. If you choose**IPv6,** enter**2001:4860:4860::8888** and**2001:4860:4860::8844** in**Preferred** and**Alternate DNS servers,** respectively.

## 11\. Reset Your Network

 If none of the steps was helpful, consider resetting the network settings. Resetting the network settings will remove and reinstall the network adapters and set the network components to their default values.

 You can[reset the network settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/reset-network-settings-windows-11/) by following the below steps.

1. Open**Settings** .
2. Choose**Network & internet** \>**Advanced network settings** \>**Network reset** .
3. Click on**Reset now** next to**Network reset** .
4. Click**Yes** to confirm your selection.
