## 30 Days in Football Fantasy: How to Play OCM for No Charge

 Championship Manager 01/02 was one of the highlights of the Championship Manager series, the precursor to the Football Manager franchise. Many soccer fanatics and more casual players still adore that retro game because it’s both an accessible yet in-depth soccer management simulator that’s not overly complex, with many playable leagues and a big database of players.

 Eidos Interactive made Championship Manager 01/02 a freely available download from 2008, and online communities have kept this classic retro game alive and kicking ever since. This is how you can play the Championship Manager 01/02 soccer management game on a Windows 11/10 PC.

## 2\. Download and Install WinCDEmu

 As the downloaded Championship Manager 01/02 file is an ISO, you will need to mount its image with WinCDEmu. WinCDEmu is one of the [best freeware software packages for mounting ISO files](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/3-free-alternatives-daemon-tools-mounting-image-files/) on a Windows PC.
