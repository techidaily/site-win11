## Immediate Printer Severance Guide for Windows Computers

 Often, you will need to remove and reconnect your printer for troubleshooting purposes. Also, removing old and unused devices helps you keep your connected device list organized in Windows 11 and 10\.

 You can remove any connected printer from the Settings panel. If that does not work, you can use the Command Prompt and other ways to remove the printer. Here, we show you the many ways to delete a printer on Windows computers.

## 1\. How to Remove a Printer From Windows via Settings

 You can easily [add or remove printers](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/printer-setup-windows-10/) from the Settings app. Here’s how to do it:

1. Press **Win + I** to open **Settings**.
2. Open the **Bluetooth & devices** tab in the left pane.  
![Printers and Scanners Settings in Windows 11 Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/printers-and-scanners-Windows-settings.jpg)

5. Click the **Remove** button in the top right corner and click **Yes** to confirm the action.

 If you encounter an error, stop the Print Spooler service in the Services snap-in and try again!

## How to Stop the Print Spooler Service

 If Windows fails to remove the printer with an error, try to stop the Print Spooler service and remove the printer. Print Spooler is an essential printer service that communicates the print job between your PC and the printer. However, it can sometimes interfere and prevent you from uninstalling the printer.

 To stop the print spooler service:

1. Press **Win + R** to open **Run**.
2. Typ**e services.msc** and click **OK** to open the **Services snap-in.**
3. In the Services window, locate the **Print Spooler service.**
4. Right-click on **Print Spooler** and select **Stop**.  
![Print Spooler Service Stop Option in Services MMC on Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/print-spooler-service-stop-1.jpg)
5. Minimize the **Services** window.
6. Now open the **Windows Settings pane**l, go to **Bluetooth & devices > Scanners and Printer**, and try to remove your printer device.
7. Once the printer is removed, go back to the **Services** window.
