[Creating a chart in Microsoft Excel](https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/top-techniques-for-enhancing-photo-quality-on-your-ios-device/) is a reasonably simple process, but it's the customizations you apply that take the most time. So, if you create a chart and want to reuse the colors and formatting, save it as a template!

 By turning your hard work into a reusable template, you can save time later. Plus, you can hang onto those company colors or [specific formatting](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-djd-snaps-adding-tracks-to-enhance-videos-for-2024/) you spent so much time applying. Best of all, you can use a chart template in any Excel workbook and sheet once you save it.
