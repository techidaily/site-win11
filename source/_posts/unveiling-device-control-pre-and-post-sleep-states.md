## How to Find Out What Woke Your Windows PC From Sleep Mode

 Many times, you may find that your Windows computer wakes from sleep mode on its own. Often, it's one of the connected devices or processes that causes your computer to wake up. Windows can tell you exactly what woke your computer from sleep mode.

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run dialog.
2. Type**cmd** in the box and press**Ctrl + Shift + Enter** to[launch Command Prompt with admin rights](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/) .
3. Input the following command and press**Enter** .  
`powercfg -lastwake`  
![Check What Woke Windows From Sleep](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Check-What-Woke-Windows-From-Sleep.jpg)

 Once you run the above command, Windows will tell you which device or process woke your computer from sleep mode.

 If you see something like**Wake History Count - 0** , it means that Windows doesn't have a record of wake history. This can happen if you've recently rebooted your computer.
