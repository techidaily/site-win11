## Peek Inside the Persona Machine: How to Launch Windows’ Secret Self-Analysis Engine

 The Private Character Editor is a Microsoft Windows program that lets you create, edit, and manage custom fonts. You can use this tool to create symbols and other characters that are not included in the standard Windows character set.

 If you want to change the way your characters look on Windows, you can do so by opening the Private Character Editor. Here's a quick guide that will help.
