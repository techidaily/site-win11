## 3\. Copy the Msvcr120.dll From Another Computer

 While troubleshooting the msvcr120.dll missing error, you might stumble upon websites that promise to fix the error through a quick download of the DLL file. However, doing so can be risky, as the file may be infected by malware.

 A safer alternative is to manually copy the msvcr120.dll file from another computer and paste it into the appropriate folder on your computer. You can transfer the msvcr120.dll file from another computer [using nearby sharing on WIndows](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-nearby-sharing-on-windows-11/) or an external storage device.

 Once you get the msvcr120.dll file, you can paste it into the appropriate folder. If you are using the 64-bit version, you should paste it into **Local Disk (C:) > Windows > System32**. For the 32-bit version, you should paste it into **Local Disk (C:) > Windows > SysWOW64**.

 If you encounter the msvcr120.dll missing error only when launching a specific app or program, it is likely that the program is unable to access the DLL file. You can try updating the problematic program to its most recent version to see if that helps.
