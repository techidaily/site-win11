## Key to the Past: Windows 11’S Historical Files Retrieval

 Microsoft introduced File History with Windows 8 and even improved the feature to some extent in Windows 10 and 11\. In Windows 10, File History also appeared in the Settings app, but that changed with Windows 11\. The backup feature is missing from the Settings app which is confusing because Microsoft is shifting sections of the Control Panel to Settings.

 But Control Panel isn’t the only way to access File History on Windows. This guide will list eight quick methods to open the File History page in Windows 11\.

## 1\. Using Start Menu

 The most obvious place to search for an app or file on Windows PC is the Start menu. You can even see web results because Microsoft integrated Bing into the Start menu. Repeat the following steps:

1. Press the **Win** key to open the Start menu.
2. Type **File History** in the search box. Click on the first relevant search result to open File History in a new window.

## 2\. Using Control Panel

 File history previously lived in the Settings app in Windows 10 but is now only present in Control Panel's System and Security section. Here's how to access it:

1. Press the Windows key, type **Control Panel** and press the Enter key.
2. In the Control Panel window, click on the **System and Security** option.
3. Scroll down and locate the **File History** option. Double-click on it to view and manage the connected devices and backups.

## 3\. Using the Settings App

 The Settings app doesn't have File History as a separate section but can redirect you to its Control Panel page. Repeat the following steps:

1. Press **Win + I** to launch the settings app.
2. Go to the left-hand side section and click on the search bar.
3. Type **File History** and click on the **Restore your files with File History** search result.

4. The Control Panel window will open with the File History page.

## 4\. Using the Run Dialog Box

 Launching programs and system apps from the Run dialog box is possible if you know the exact file name or the file path. Repeat the following steps:

1. Press **Win+ R** to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type **control /name Microsoft.FileHistory** in the text box and press the **Enter** key.  
![Open File History Using Run dialog box](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/open-file-history-using-run-dialog-box.jpg)
3. The File History page will open.

## 5\. Using File Explorer

 Like most Windows utilities, File History is also present in the **System32** folder in the C drive. So, you can access it from there in case [Control Panel is not opening](https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-control-panel-wont-open/) or working on your PC. Repeat the following steps:

1. Press **Win + E** to [open the File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/).
2. Go to the address bar on the top of the File Explorer window and click on it.
3. Paste the following path in it and press the Enter key: **C:\\Windows\\System32**
4. Now, go to the search box present in the top right corner and type File History. Press the **Enter** key to initiate a search.
5. Double-click on the **FileHistory.exe** file to open the tool.

## 6\. Using Task Manager

 Task Manager isn’t just meant for ending tasks and sub-processes. You can launch any system app or tools, and access file locations using the Run new task option. Here’s how:

1. Press the **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** keys simultaneously to [open the Task Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-open-task-manager-windows-10/).
2. Click on the **Run new task** button. Now, type **FileHistory.exe** in the text box and click on the **OK** button.  
![Open File History Using Task Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/open-file-history-using-task-manager.jpg)
3. File History will launch on your system. Close the Task Manager

## 7\. Using Terminal App

 If you love the terminal and don’t like the idea of opening menus or searching for an app or tool, you can open File History using the Terminal app. Here’s how to do it:

1. Right-click on the Start button to open the Power User menu.
2. Click on the **Terminal** option.
3. Now, type the following command and press the **Enter** key to execute it: **control /name Microsoft.FileHistory**  
![Open File History Using Terminal App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/open-file-history-using-terminal-app.jpg)
4. Close the Terminal app.

## 8\. Using a Desktop Shortcut

 The fastest method to access any app is by [creating a desktop shortcut](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-create-desktop-shortcuts-from-anywhere-in-windows/). You can switch to the desktop and launch programs with or without administrator privileges. Repeat the following steps:

1. Press **Win + D** to switch to the desktop.
2. Right-click on the Desktop. Select the **New > Shortcut** option from the context menu.
3. In the Create Shortcut window, go to the textbox. Type **"C:\\Windows\\System32\\FileHistory.exe"** in the text box and click on the **Next** button.  
![Open File History Using Desktop shortcut](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/open-file-history-using-desktop-shortcut.jpg)
4. Name the shortcut **File History** and click on the **Finish** button.
5. Switch to the desktop. Double-click on the newly created File History shortcut to launch the tool.

## Access File History Settings In a Jiffy

 Microsoft came with this excellent physical backup option for Windows OS. Now, you know eight easy methods to access File History, run a manual backup session, and tweak its settings. You can even add and remove folders in File History, but that requires a bit more effort.

 But Control Panel isn’t the only way to access File History on Windows. This guide will list eight quick methods to open the File History page in Windows 11\.
