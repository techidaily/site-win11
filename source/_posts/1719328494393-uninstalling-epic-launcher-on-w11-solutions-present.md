## Uninstalling Epic Launcher on W11 - Solutions Present

 Are you struggling to uninstall Epic Games Launcher on Windows 11? Most of the time, there’s a background process still running so the fix should be quick and easy. However, this isn’t always the case so the classical way of uninstalling software isn’t enough to fix the problem.

 If you're facing the same issue, you don't have to worry. We’ll take a look at five methods that are worth a try when you can’t uninstall the Epic Games Launcher app.

## 1\. Close Epic Games Background Processes

 If you try to uninstall Epic Games Launcher, but Windows shows you the “Epic Games Launcher is currently running” message, there’s a background process stopping you. Even if you haven’t launched the app, its process might already run if it’s set to launch at system startup.

 However, you can easily stop the app from running in the background.

1. Right-click the **Start** button and select **Task Manager**.
2. Open the **Processes** tab.
3. Right-click **EpicGamesLauncher** and select **End Task**.

 If you still can’t uninstall Epic Games Launcher, move on to the next solution.

## 2\. Run the Install and Uninstall Troubleshooter

 Windows it’s trying its best to give you the necessary troubleshooting tools for every problem you might encounter. While there’s no built-in troubleshooter to help you uninstall stubborn software, you can use [Microsoft’s Install and Uninstall Troubleshooter](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed-cca7d1b6-65a9-3d98-426b-e9f927e1eb4d). Here’s how you can use it after you’ve downloaded it:

1. Launch the Install and Uninstall Troubleshooter and click **Yes** in the UAC window.
2. Click **Next** **\> Uninstalling**.

3. Choose **Epic Games Launcher** from the list of programs and click **Next**.
4. Select **Yes, try uninstall**.

## 3\. Uninstall Epic Games Using Command Prompt

 There are [different ways to uninstall software in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/), and most people use Control Panel to remove software. However, it might not be the best choice especially when it comes to problematic apps. So, if the classical method didn’t work, it’s time to give Command Prompt a try.

1. [Launch Command Prompt with administrative rights](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/).
2. Type the **wmic** and press **Enter**.
3. Copy and run the **product where name="Epic Games Launcher" call uninstall** command line.
4. Confirm the action by typing **Y** and pressing **Enter**.

 Wait for Command Prompt to uninstall the app. If it displays the **Method executions successful** message, Epic Games Launcher is now uninstalled.

## 4\. Delete Epic Games From Registry

 If the Command Prompt method didn’t work, you should delete the Epic Games Launcher entries in the Registry Editor.

1. Launching Registry Editor with administrative rights.
2. In the Registry window, navigate to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE > SOFTWARE > Microsoft > Windows > CurrentVersion > Uninstall**. Windows shows installed programs using a combination of letters and numbers, so it might be difficult to identify which one corresponds to Epic Games Launcher.
3. Click each key one at a time and check the value displayed next to **Display Name**.
4. Once you find the right key, double-click **UninstallString** from the right pane and copy the **Value data** information.
5. To uninstall Epic Games Launcher, press **Windows key + R** to bring up a Run dialog. There, paste the Registry value and click **OK**.

 Before editing the Registry, you should [manually create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) in case something goes wrong.

## 5\. Uninstall Epic Games in Safe Mode

 If Epic Games Launcher is still doing its best to stop you from uninstalling it, there’s a chance a background process is still interfering. In this case, you should [start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-boot-safe-mode/). By doing so, your system will start without any additional drivers and apps that might lead to conflict.

## 6\. Use a Third-Party App

 Instead of editing the Registry or running command lines, you can have a third-party app do the job for you. If you haven’t used a similar app before, check out our guide on [the best uninstallers to remove stubborn apps in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-uninstallers-stubborn-apps/).
