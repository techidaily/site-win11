 Are you unable to save your PowerPoint presentation and getting the "An error occurred while PowerPoint was saving the file" error? Needless to say, it can be really frustrating, besides disrupting your workflow.

 If you've already restarted your computer without success, it's time to explore more advanced solutions. Here are six quick solutions that will help you troubleshoot the PowerPoint can't save file error in no time.

## 2\. Copy All Slides to a Different File

 Sometimes, the problem might lie within the presentation file itself rather than your computer. In this case, you can transfer all slides to a new presentation.

 To do this, copy all the slides from the presentation causing the issue, and then create a new presentation and paste them into it.

 Then, enter your credentials to log in with your account. Check if you still get the error message on saving your presentation.

## 4\. Remove Problematic Objects From the Slide

 An unsupported object in your presentation can also prevent you from saving the file. In this case, you'll need to go through each slide in your presentation and look for the problematic object.

 To find the problematic object, copy all inserted objects and paste them into a new slide. The object that is [failing to copy and paste](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-copy-paste-not-working/) into the new slide is the culprit.

 Remove that object from your presentation, and then try to save the file. If you still get the error, continue with the guide.
