 Need to stamp a date on a spreadsheet? In Microsoft Excel, you have multiple ways to add today's date in your spreadsheets. You can add both static and dynamic dates, and we'll show you how.

##  Static vs Dynamic Dates in Excel

 When you add a **static date** in your Excel spreadsheet, the date does not update when you [recalculate your worksheet](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/detailed-guide-to-screen-record-skype-via-obs-for-2024/) or you reopen the spreadsheet. It remains the same no matter what you do.

 On the other hand, when you add a **dynamic date** to your spreadsheet, the date updates when you recalculate your worksheet or you reopen the spreadsheet. This date is added with an Excel function, which is why it's updated when you perform recalculation.

 In either case, Excel fetches the current date from [your computer's system clock](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-honor-magic-6-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), so make sure it's set to use the correct date.

##  Insert Today's Date as a Static Date in Excel

 To insert today's date as a static value in your spreadsheet, first, open your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel.

 In the spreadsheet, click the cell in which you want to display today's date.

##  Add Today's Date as a Dynamic Date in Excel

 To add today's date in such a way that it updates when you recalculate or reopen your spreadsheet, use the Excel formula for today's date, 

        `TODAY`
    
 .

 To use it, open your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel. Then click the cell in which you want to display the date.

![Select a cell to display the date in an Excel spreadsheet.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-select-cell.png) 

 In the cell, type the following function and press Enter:

=TODAY()

 To add both the current date and time, use the `=NOW()` formula instead.

![Enter the function to add today's date.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-excel-today-function.png)

##  Change the Date Format in Excel

 If you prefer a specific format for your dates, Excel has an option to [customize the date format](https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-from-playback-to-printout-top-five-methods-of-documenting-minecraft-on-a-mac-for-2024/). This way, you can display your date in whatever format you desire.

 To do that for your date, [right-click](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-art-of-recording-fun-6-techniques-to-document-minecraft-for-2024/) your date cell and select "Format Cells" from the menu.

![Right-click the date cell and choose "Format Cells."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5-format-date-cell-excel.png) 

 On the "Format Cells" window, from the "Type" section on the right, select the format you want for your date. Then click "OK" at the bottom.
