## Modifying Taskbar to Feature Numeric Keys on Windows 11

 Most keyboards include a Num, Caps, and Scroll Lock key. Pressing those keys activates or deactivates their functions. Although many keyboards have indicator lights highlighting whether those keys are on or off, a lot of wireless ones don’t for the sake of preserving batteries.

 Does your keyboard lack indicator lights for its lock keys? If so, you can add lock button indicators to Windows 11’s system tray to make up for your keyboard’s lack. This is how you can add new lock key indicators to Windows 11’s system tray with TrayStatus, AddLED, and Keyboard LEDs.

## How to Add Num, Caps, and Scroll Lock Indicators With TrayStatus

 TrayStatus lets you add lock key statuses, alongside a variety of system performance indicators, to the system tray.

 This software is freely available for personal use, but there’s also a Pro Standard version with additional features. You can try out TrayStatus Pro Standard for 30 days before it reverts to the free version.

 This is how to add system tray lock key indicators with TrayStatus:

1. Open this [TrayStatus homepage](https://www.traystatus.com/).
2. Click the **Download Free Trial** \> **Download Installer Now** buttons.
3. Double-click **TrayStatusSetup-4.7.1.exe** to open the TrayStatus setup.
4. Go through the setup, then select the **Use Trial Version** radio button and click **Next**.
5. ![The Use Trial Version radio button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-use-trial-version-radio-button.jpg)
6. Click **Install** in the next window.  
![The Install option for TrayStatus](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-install-option.jpg)
7. Press **Finish** with the **Launch Now** checkbox selected to run SystemTray.

 Now you should see Caps and Num Lock key indicators in the Windows system tray area, which are enabled within the software’s settings by default after installation. The **1** icon is the Num Lock indicator, and the **a** status indicator is for Caps Lock. The **a** indicator becomes a capital **A** when Caps Lock is on. The **1** indicator has a white or black background when Num Lock is on.

![Caps and Num Lock system tray indicators](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/traystatus-indicator.jpg)

 To add a Scroll Lock indicator and others, right-click the TrayStatus Caps Lock icon in the system tray and select **Settings**. Click the **Status Indicators** tab and select **Show Scroll Lock Status**. You can also choose to show Ctrl, Alt, Win, Shift, RAM, CPU, and hard drive indicators on the system tray from there. The RAM and CPU indicators are handy for [checking system resource usage in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-check-ram-gpu-cpu-usage/).

![The Status Indicators tab in TrayStatus](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/indicator-options.jpg)

 Click on the drop-down menu to select **Light Icons** or **Dark Icons** options. Light is better for dark Windows themes. However, dark indicators will likely be more visible on a light Windows taskbar. Select **Apply** to set your new settings.

## How to Add Num, Caps, and Scroll Lock Indicators With AddLEDs

 AddLEDs is an alternative to TrayStatus that should work ok on Windows platforms from 7 to 11\. This freeware software adds Scroll, Num, and Caps Lock indicators along with two others for network and disk usage.

 It also enables you to set a beep sound when you press the lock keys. You can add lock button indicators to your Windows system tray with AddLEDs as follows:

1. Bring up the [AddLEDs download page](https://www.wintools.info/index.php/addleds).
2. Click the **Download** link at the bottom of that webpage.
3. Open File Explorer and the folder where the AddLEDs file was downloaded.
4. Double-click the **addleds.exe** file to run the software (no installation is required).

 You will now see five new indicators appear within the Windows system tray area. The **1**, **a**, and **S** icons are the **Num**, **Caps**, and **Scroll Lock** indicators. The flashing **D** and **N** icons are indicators for disk and network activity.

![AddLEDs' system tray indicators](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/addled-indicators.jpg)

 If you prefer to remove a few indicators, right-click one of the AddLEDs icons in the system tray. Then move the mouse cursor over **Show** to deselect the selected indicator options there.

 AddLEDs has a few settings with which you can change the color scheme of its system tray indicators. Right-click one of the indicators and move the cursor over Icon Indicators to view those options. Then you can select color scheme options like **Transparent**, **Black/White**, **Blue/Red/Green**, **Green/Red**, and **Red/Blue**.

 What looks more like a battery icon with three boxes will appear in your system tray after starting Keyboard LEDs. Those boxes go red when you turn on Num, Caps, and Scroll Lock. The left box is for Num, the central box is for Caps, and the right one is the Scroll Lock indicator.

![Keyboard LEDs' system tray indicators](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/keyboard-led-indicator.jpg)

 To configure the indicators, right-click the Keyboard LEDs icon to select **Settings**. You can choose different colors for each indicator box by clicking the color drop-down menus for the **Led 1**, **2**, and **3** drop-down menus. Click the button drop-down menus to change the lock key indicator for each box.

![The Keyboard LEDs window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/keyboard-led-window.jpg)

 Select the **On Screen Display** checkbox and its **Caps**, **Scroll**, and **Num Lock** settings to see the alternative lock key indicators. Enabling that setting adds text-based indicators just above the system tray area, as in the snapshot below. Those indicators tell you if their lock keys are turned on or off.
