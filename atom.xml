    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Troubleshooting-0X30017-Update-Issue-in-Windows-OS"><a href="#Troubleshooting-0X30017-Update-Issue-in-Windows-OS" class="headerlink" title="Troubleshooting 0X30017 Update Issue in Windows OS"></a>Troubleshooting 0X30017 Update Issue in Windows OS</h2><p> The update error 0xC1900101 – 0x30017 pops up when the users try to either install a system update or upgrade to the latest Windows version. There can be a number of reasons behind this issue, such as insufficient space for the update, antivirus installation, and corruption issues within the system.</p><p> The following sections discuss the possible causes and troubleshooting methods for this error. Select the troubleshooting method that is most appropriate for your situation and proceed with it.</p><h2 id="What-Causes-the-0xC1900101-–-0x30017-Error"><a href="#What-Causes-the-0xC1900101-–-0x30017-Error" class="headerlink" title="What Causes the 0xC1900101 – 0x30017 Error?"></a>What Causes the 0xC1900101 – 0x30017 Error?</h2><p> Here are some common reasons behind the update error under consideration:</p><ul><li><strong>Insufficient space</strong> - You must have at least 16 GB of free space to upgrade to the latest version of Windows. If you have insufficient space on your computer, you can try removing the unnecessary, junk files to make space for the upgrade.</li><li><strong>Antivirus interruption</strong> - Your third-party antivirus program or Windows Defender might be blocking the update as a result of a false alarm. If this scenario is applicable, you can try disabling or uninstalling the program to fix the problem.</li><li><strong>Corrupt system files</strong> - The essential system or update files can be facing a corruption issue, which is leading to the update installation failure. Later in this guide, we discuss a couple of methods you can try to resolve these bugs and generic corruption errors.</li><li><strong>Outdated drivers</strong> - All the installed drivers should be up-to-date for the system to successfully upgrade. It is best to look for outdated drivers in the Device Manager and upgrade them before you attempt to install the updates.</li><li><strong>Outdated BIOS</strong> - Your BIOS itself might be outdated, affecting your system’s functioning and causing issues like the update error. In most cases, if your BIOS is outdated or faulty, you will also face common issues like a Blue Screen of Death.</li></ul><p> Now that we know about the potential causes of the issue, let’s take a look at the solutions you can try to resolve the problem. Before proceeding, we recommend that you remove any unnecessary external peripherals like USB from your computer.</p><h2 id="1-Free-Up-Storage-Space"><a href="#1-Free-Up-Storage-Space" class="headerlink" title="1. Free Up Storage Space"></a>1. Free Up Storage Space</h2><p> As we mentioned earlier, you must have at least 16 GB of free space on your system to install new updates. If you do not have storage space, the best way to clear it is by deleting the unnecessary apps and programs you have installed on your computer.</p><p> Apart from that, it also will be a good idea to remove the previous installation files from the system. In addition to clearing the space, this will also solve any interruption issues that these previous installation files may cause during the upgrade process. In case you are using two SSDs on your computer, remove one and then try installing the update.</p><p> Head over to our guide on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-free-up-storage-space/" >different methods of freeing up storage space in Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more information.</p><h2 id="2-Uninstall-Your-Antivirus"><a href="#2-Uninstall-Your-Antivirus" class="headerlink" title="2. Uninstall Your Antivirus"></a>2. Uninstall Your Antivirus</h2><p> If you are using a third-party antivirus program on your computer, it may be blocking the system’s process of installing updates. The solution in this case is simple, as all that you need to do is disable or uninstall the security program temporarily.</p><p> Below, we have discussed the steps of disabling the antivirus using Avast. The steps for your antivirus program might differ slightly.</p><p>Here is how you can do that:</p><ol><li>Right-click on the<strong>antivirus program icon</strong> in the taskbar.</li><li>Choose<strong>Shields control</strong> &gt;<strong>Disable until the computer is restarted</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/disable-antivirus.jpg"                      alt="Temporarily disable antivirus"                ></li></ol><p> If you are not using a third-party security program, you can try<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-turn-off-windows-defender/" >disabling Windows Defender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well. However, we highly recommend that you enable it back after installing the update. Keeping it disabled for a long time can expose your system to risks and potential threats.</p><h2 id="3-Rule-Out-Corruption-Issues"><a href="#3-Rule-Out-Corruption-Issues" class="headerlink" title="3. Rule Out Corruption Issues"></a>3. Rule Out Corruption Issues</h2><p> The next thing that we recommend doing is scanning the system for corruption issues using the built-in troubleshooting utilities in Windows.</p><p> To fix this, we will be using the Windows update troubleshooter, System File Checker, and DISM to find potential issues. Additionally, these utilities will resolve most of the problems they find on their own.</p><h3 id="3-1-Use-the-Windows-Update-Troubleshooter"><a href="#3-1-Use-the-Windows-Update-Troubleshooter" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Use the Windows Update Troubleshooter"></a>3.1 Use the Windows Update Troubleshooter</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static0.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/windows-update-troubleshooter.jpg"                      alt="Run the Windows Update troubleshooter"                ></p><p> You can run the Windows Update troubleshooter via Windows Settings. Instructions on how to run the troubleshooter can be found in our guide on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-update-stuck/" >how to fix Windows Update getting stuck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Once the troubleshooter has finished scanning, check if any issues are identified. If so, the troubleshooter will recommend fixes that can resolve the issue. Click on<strong>Apply this fix</strong> to proceed. In case the utility fails to identify the issues, click on Close the troubleshooter and move to the next method below.</p><h3 id="3-2-Run-SFC-and-DISM-Scans"><a href="#3-2-Run-SFC-and-DISM-Scans" class="headerlink" title="3.2 Run SFC and DISM Scans"></a>3.2 Run SFC and DISM Scans</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static0.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/SFC-and-DISM-Scan.jpg"                      alt="SFC and DISM Scan"                ></p><p> The next thing that you should do is run the SFC and DISM scans via Command Prompt. Check out<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/difference-between-chkdsk-sfc-and-dism-in-windows-10/" >the difference between CHKDSK, SFC, and DISM scans <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more information and instructions for these tools.</p><p> As the name suggests, the System File Checker scans the protected system files for problems and replaces the unhealthy file components with their cached counterparts. DISM, on the other hand, is responsible for repairing a corrupt system image.</p><p> Hopefully, if the system cannot install updates because of corruption issues, these tools will eliminate the problem.</p><h2 id="4-Update-Your-Drivers"><a href="#4-Update-Your-Drivers" class="headerlink" title="4. Update Your Drivers"></a>4. Update Your Drivers</h2><p> Ideally, your drivers must be kept up-to-date at all times for the system to function smoothly. To check if there are any outdated drivers on your system, head over to the Device Manager utility.</p><p> Expand all sections, and look for any drivers with a yellow exclamation mark. This sign indicates that the driver is either outdated or corrupt. Once you have identified a faulty driver, right-click on it and choose<strong>Update driver</strong> &gt;<strong>Search the system for drivers</strong> .</p><p> Wait for the update process of the driver complete and check if the issue is resolved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/keyboard-update-driver.jpg"                      alt="Update the relevant driver"                ></p><p> If you don’t see any exclamation marks, or you don’t think Windows managed to do a good enough job, check out<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-best-free-driver-updaters/" >the best free driver updaters for Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="5-Update-Your-BIOS"><a href="#5-Update-Your-BIOS" class="headerlink" title="5. Update Your BIOS"></a>5. Update Your BIOS</h2><p> Finally, the issue can also be caused due to a bug or corruption issues within the BIOS. Fortunately, you can resolve most of these issues by updating the BIOS to the latest available version.</p><p> It’s good practice to update your BIOS when a new version comes out. And there are plenty of<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-why-you-should-update-pc-bios/" >reasons why you should update your PC’s BIOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , including unlocking additional hardware support.</p><p> Different motherboard manufacturers have different instructions for this, so we recommend visiting the manufacturer’s website for more information. Keep in mind, this can be a nerve-wracking and time-consuming process, so only proceed when you have enough time to spare.</p><h2 id="Now-You-Can-Upgrade-Windows-to-the-Latest-Build"><a href="#Now-You-Can-Upgrade-Windows-to-the-Latest-Build" class="headerlink" title="Now You Can Upgrade Windows to the Latest Build"></a>Now You Can Upgrade Windows to the Latest Build</h2><p> By now, you should be able to upgrade your operating system to the latest available version. In case nothing the troubleshooting methods above do not help, we recommend proceeding with a clean installation. This will automatically upgrade the system without any errors during the procedure.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/personalize-your-keyboard-precise-text-pasting-hotkeys/"><u>Personalize Your Keyboard: Precise Text Pasting Hotkeys</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/utilizing-the-fn-key-operations-and-tips/"><u>Utilizing the FN Key: Operations and Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/master-your-media-8-superior-windows-video-slicers/"><u>Master Your Media - 8 Superior Windows Video Slicers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/crafting-an-autonomous-windows-speech-transcription-app-with-whisper-aid/"><u>Crafting an Autonomous Windows Speech Transcription App with Whisper Aid</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/bitlockers-encryption-is-broken-but-its-still-not-time-to-switch/"><u>BitLocker's Encryption Is Broken, But It's Still Not Time to Switch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/regaining-control-over-icon-placement/"><u>Regaining Control Over Icon Placement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/altering-network-addresses-on-win11/"><u>Altering Network Addresses on Win11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/simplifying-everlasting-file-elimination-on-your-desktop-bin-with-windows-11/"><u>Simplifying Everlasting File Elimination on Your Desktop Bin with Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/optimize-your-workday-the-top-5-apps-to-skyrocket-windows-efficiency/"><u>Optimize Your Workday: The Top 5 Apps to Skyrocket Windows Efficiency</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-learn-the-layers-of-photography-with-snapseed/"><u>[Updated] Learn the Layers of Photography with Snapseed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/restore-missing-app-icon-on-realme-12-proplus-5g-step-by-step-solutions-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Restore Missing App Icon on Realme 12 Pro+ 5G Step-by-Step Solutions | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-elitemac-pro-high-definition-visuals-plus-audiophile-recordings/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, EliteMac Pro  High-Definition Visuals + Audiophile Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-engaging-stories-through-customized-instagram-quests-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Engaging Stories Through Customized Instagram Quests for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-elite-mp4-media-sender/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Elite MP4 Media Sender</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-techniques-for-smoothly-fading-audio-within-lumafusion/"><u>2024 Approved  Techniques for Smoothly Fading Audio Within Lumafusion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/new-10-essential-online-resources-for-generating-perfect-waveforms/"><u>New 10 Essential Online Resources for Generating Perfect Waveforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/engaging-audiences-the-path-to-instagram-video-fame-for-2024/"><u>Engaging Audiences  The Path to Instagram Video Fame for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/punpixel-the-ultimate-tool-for-digital-humor-for-2024/"><u>PunPixel  The Ultimate Tool for Digital Humor for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-critical-insight-into-recmeisters-video-capture-efficacy/"><u>[New] Critical Insight Into Recmeister's Video Capture Efficacy</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Confronting-Correcting-‘Uninitialized-Disk’-Errors-in-Win"><a href="#Confronting-Correcting-‘Uninitialized-Disk’-Errors-in-Win" class="headerlink" title="Confronting &amp; Correcting ‘Uninitialized Disk’ Errors in Win"></a>Confronting &amp; Correcting ‘Uninitialized Disk’ Errors in Win</h2><p> Does Disk Management display the message “Disk Unknown, Not Initialized” when you connect an external drive, an SSD, an HDD, or a pen drive to your computer? The issue occurs primarily due to MBR corruption. However, incorrectly connecting the drive to your system, bad disk sectors, data corruption, and a failing hard drive can also trigger the error.</p><p> If you want to resolve this issue and successfully load the data, here are a few fixes you should try.</p><h2 id="1-Check-for-Connection-Issues"><a href="#1-Check-for-Connection-Issues" class="headerlink" title="1. Check for Connection Issues"></a>1. Check for Connection Issues</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/laptop-and-usb-cable.jpg"                      alt="USB cable plugged into a laptop&#39;s USB port"                ></p><p> Check for possible connection issues between the hard drive and your computer before investigating any other causes. To start, unplug and re-plug the hard drive into your laptop to eliminate any temporary connection problems.</p><p> In addition, make sure the hard drive’s connection cable is intact and there is no visible damage to any part of it. Also, clean both ends of the cable with a cloth to ensure no dust or debris is stuck inside them, preventing the disk from initializing.</p><p> If none of the above temporary issues appear to be the culprit, look for possible port issues.</p><h2 id="2-Ensure-Your-USB-Port-Isn’t-Faulty"><a href="#2-Ensure-Your-USB-Port-Isn’t-Faulty" class="headerlink" title="2. Ensure Your USB Port Isn’t Faulty"></a>2. Ensure Your USB Port Isn’t Faulty</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pexels-castorly-stock-4065705.jpg"                      alt="Close-up picture of a Laptop’s USB ports"                ></p><p> A faulty USB port can also prevent your system from detecting the hard drive, resulting in the issue under discussion. Hence, it’s imperative to ensure that the USB port is functioning correctly. To confirm that, just swap ports, i.e., plug the external drive into a different port than where it was connected before.</p><p> If the external drive starts working immediately after switching ports, the port it was connected to earlier is either incompatible with your drive or has a problem. Thus, you should either keep using the other USB port or apply the fixes covered in our guide on <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/dead-usb-port-heres-how-to-diagnose-and-fix-it/" >how to fix USB port issues on Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to make the faulty port work again.</p><h2 id="3-Scan-and-Resolve-Hard-Drive-Issues"><a href="#3-Scan-and-Resolve-Hard-Drive-Issues" class="headerlink" title="3. Scan and Resolve Hard Drive Issues"></a>3. Scan and Resolve Hard Drive Issues</h2><p> If there is no connection issue and your USB port is functioning correctly, you should scan and fix file system issues with your hard drive. Windows offers a utility named CHKDSK, which assesses the file system structure, addresses file name linkage issues, and looks for bad clusters, among other operations. Usually, running this utility fixes hard drive problems.</p><p> Before running the scan, open the File Explorer and find the drive letter marked as <strong>disk unknown, not initialized</strong>. After you have that in mind, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>In Windows Search, enter <strong>“cmd,”</strong> right-click on the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> app, and select <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</li><li>Type the following command in Command Prompt and press <strong>Enter</strong>:<br><code>Chkdsk &lt;drive letter&gt;: /r /f</code></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/scanning-the-bad-disk-sectors-using-the-chkdsk-command-in-command-prompt.jpg"                      alt="Scanning the Bad Disk Sectors Using the CHKDSK Command in Command Prompt"                ></p><p> Ensure you enter the correct drive letter for the scan to work.</p><h2 id="4-Update-the-Disk-Drive-Drivers"><a href="#4-Update-the-Disk-Drive-Drivers" class="headerlink" title="4. Update the Disk Drive Drivers"></a>4. Update the Disk Drive Drivers</h2><p> Having outdated drivers can also disrupt the normal functioning of your disk drive, making it impossible for it to initialize. To ensure that’s not the cause of the issue, you should update the disk drive drivers. Here are the steps you need to take:</p><ol><li>Right-click on the Windows <strong>Start</strong> button and open <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Expand the <strong>Disk drives</strong> category.</li><li>Right-click on your desired drive and click <strong>Update driver</strong>.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/updating-the-disk-drive-drivers-1.jpg"                      alt="updating the disk drive drivers in the device manager"                ></li></ol><h2 id="5-Rebuild-the-MBR"><a href="#5-Rebuild-the-MBR" class="headerlink" title="5. Rebuild the MBR"></a>5. Rebuild the MBR</h2><p> If the above fixes do not resolve the issue, rebuild the MBR, which is a boot sector at the beginning of the hard drive. When it gets corrupted, you’re likely to encounter problems. You can rebuild the MBR in several ways, but using a third-party app like Minitool Partition Wizard is the easiest. Here are the steps you should follow:</p><ol><li>Go to <a class="link"   href="https://www.partitionwizard.com/download.html" >MiniTool’s official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and download the <strong>MiniTool Partition Wizard</strong>.</li><li>Install the software by running the setup file and following the on-screen instructions. You don’t need to buy the premium edition; the free version will do the job.</li><li>Once installed, search for <strong>“MiniTool Partition Wizard”</strong> in Windows Search, and then run the app.</li><li>Right-click on the problematic disk and select <strong>Initialize to MBR Disk</strong>. Then, click <strong>Apply</strong>.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/click-on-initialize-to-mbr-disk-in-the-minitool-partition-wizard.jpg"                      alt="Click on Initialize to MBR Disk in the MiniTool Partition Wizard"                ></li><li>Right-click on the disk again, and then click <strong>Rebuild MBR</strong>. Then, click <strong>Apply</strong> once more.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/click-on-rebuild-mbr-in-the-minitool-partition-wizard.jpg"                      alt="Click on Rebuild MBR in the MiniTool Partition Wizard"                ></li><li>Right-click the disk again and select <strong>Create</strong>. Then, click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol><h2 id="6-Format-the-Disk-and-Create-a-New-Partition"><a href="#6-Format-the-Disk-and-Create-a-New-Partition" class="headerlink" title="6. Format the Disk and Create a New Partition"></a>6. Format the Disk and Create a New Partition</h2><p> If the drive that fails to initialize is empty or contains no essential data, you should format it. Then, you can create a new partition by converting its format to GPT and assigning the new volume. It is the most recommended method for resolving the issue and has worked for many users. To accomplish that, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>In Windows Search, type <strong>“cmd,”</strong> then right-click on the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> app and choose <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</li><li>In Command Prompt, type <strong>“diskpart”</strong> and press <strong>Enter.</strong></li><li>Then, type <strong>“list disk”</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>. Then, you’ll see how many drives you have on your device.</li><li>Depending on which drive you are having problems with, type <strong>“Disk 0”</strong> or <strong>“Disk 1”</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Once the disk is selected, type <strong>“clean”</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong> to format it.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/clean-disk-disk-part-command-prompt.jpg"                      alt="run the clean disk disk part command in windows command prompt"                ></li><li>Then, type <strong>“GPT”</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong> to convert the disk to GPT format.</li><li>To create a new partition on a formatted drive, type <strong>“create partition primary”</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Then, type <strong>“format quick fs&#x3D;ntfs”</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong> to format the volume.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/quick-format-ntfs-usb-drive-command-prompt.jpg"                      alt="quick format ntfs usb drive command prompt"                ></li><li>Lastly, type <strong>“assign”</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong> to assign the drive letter.</li></ol><p> If the external drive presenting the error under discussion contains essential data, you shouldn’t format it, as you’ll lose data this way.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Windows-11’S-‘S-Mode’-Understanding-Its-Role-in-Security"><a href="#Windows-11’S-‘S-Mode’-Understanding-Its-Role-in-Security" class="headerlink" title="Windows 11’S ‘S Mode’: Understanding Its Role in Security"></a>Windows 11’S ‘S Mode’: Understanding Its Role in Security</h2><p> Windows S Mode puts your computer on complete lockdown. Once activated, S Mode lets you enjoy the highest level of security Microsoft can offer. However, there are limitations.</p><p> If you’re a Windows user, you should get the complete picture before you get a computer in Windows 11 S mode. So, let’s explore what it is and if it’s for you.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Windows-11-S-Mode"><a href="#What-Is-Windows-11-S-Mode" class="headerlink" title="What Is Windows 11 S Mode?"></a>What Is Windows 11 S Mode?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-laptop.jpg"                      alt="photo of a person using a laptop"                ></p><p> S Mode is a feature that Microsoft created to give users a secure, smooth experience with the Windows operating system. When you use Windows 11 in S mode, your computer only gets access to basic resources and drivers. More notably, S mode freezes all other apps that hog your RAM and processes that may task your CPU. These changes in your user experience of Windows S mode will sound very familiar if you have used a Chromebook.</p><h2 id="Should-You-Use-Your-PC-in-S-Mode"><a href="#Should-You-Use-Your-PC-in-S-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Should You Use Your PC in S Mode?"></a>Should You Use Your PC in S Mode?</h2><p> It depends on your security and privacy goals. Here are four reasons you may consider using a PC in Windows S Mode:</p><h3 id="1-You-Want-to-Ensure-Your-Child’s-Safety"><a href="#1-You-Want-to-Ensure-Your-Child’s-Safety" class="headerlink" title="1. You Want to Ensure Your Child’s Safety"></a>1. You Want to Ensure Your Child’s Safety</h3><p> S mode restricts the applications that can run on the computer to Microsoft Store applications only. So, your child cannot download software from third-party sources. Also, they can only browse the web on Microsoft Edge. The Windows native browser has additional online security to prevent them from visiting unsafe websites. However, Edge does not exactly block access to all sites. So, you should consider other <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-parental-control-apps-windows/" >parental control options for PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> You may also want to get a standard PC for your child and put it in S mode if you don’t want to buy a Chromebook for almost the same price. You may then take the computer out of S mode as their tech needs and ability to handle more responsibilities increase. But remember, deactivating S mode is quite easy, and your school-age child may learn to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-ways-children-might-bypass-parental-control-software/" >bypass parental controls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="2-You-Handle-Sensitive-Documents"><a href="#2-You-Handle-Sensitive-Documents" class="headerlink" title="2. You Handle Sensitive Documents"></a>2. You Handle Sensitive Documents</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-pc-in-tab-mode.jpg"                      alt="photo of person using a pc in tab mode"                ></p><p> Window S mode prevents users from installing third-party apps. This restriction means your chances of installing malware on your computer reduce significantly. So, if you are a businessperson who routinely handles documents containing company secrets, you may use your personal computer in S mode.</p><p> Remember, you cannot use in-house or proprietary software in S-mode. So, if your company developed an app for its business, running S mode will prevent you from using it. Using your Windows 11 Home in S mode is only helpful pending when you get a company laptop running Windows Pro or Enterprise.</p><h3 id="3-You-Want-to-Do-a-Digital-Detox"><a href="#3-You-Want-to-Do-a-Digital-Detox" class="headerlink" title="3. You Want to Do a Digital Detox"></a>3. You Want to Do a Digital Detox</h3><p> If you find yourself needing an <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-digital-detox-tools-to-boost-productivity/" >escape from digital noise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> but can’t avoid your main PC entirely, consider getting a PC in S mode. Games on Microsoft Store aren’t the most exciting. And many handy third-party apps aren’t there either. So, you will be using only the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-built-in-productivity-features/" >apps necessary for your productivity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> However, remember that S mode is a one-way street. There’s no leaving S mode and going back. So, if you need to install a new non-Microsoft Store app for work, you’ll have to leave S mode. The alternative would be using a separate computer or web-based version of the app, if available. If these options sound like a hassle or you don’t want to buy another PC, you can always <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-install-multiple-bootable-operating-systems-on-one-usb-stick/" >dual-boot another operating system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead.</p><h3 id="4-You-Want-the-Chromebook-Experience"><a href="#4-You-Want-the-Chromebook-Experience" class="headerlink" title="4. You Want the Chromebook Experience"></a>4. You Want the Chromebook Experience</h3><p> S mode gives you a similar experience to what a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-a-chromebook/" >Chromebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> gives. So, you can get a high-end PC and try S mode for several days or weeks. This way, you can decide if you want all that power or if the basics work for you. More importantly, you retain the option to leave anytime you want—something you don’t get in Chromebooks.</p><h3 id="5-Your-Computer-Boots-Faster"><a href="#5-Your-Computer-Boots-Faster" class="headerlink" title="5. Your Computer Boots Faster"></a>5. Your Computer Boots Faster</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/windows-booting.jpg"                      alt="photo of a windows PC booting"                ></p><p> If you have been using a Windows computer for a while, you’ll know notice how booting takes longer as you install more apps. This lag is because some <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-startup-programs-autoruns/" >autorun apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> start working in the background once you turn on your computer. Third-party software and malware, especially, cause this lag. S mode lets you use apps optimized for Windows and reduces your risks of getting malware that slows down your computer.</p><h2 id="What-Are-the-Drawbacks-of-Using-S-Mode"><a href="#What-Are-the-Drawbacks-of-Using-S-Mode" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Drawbacks of Using S Mode?"></a>What Are the Drawbacks of Using S Mode?</h2><p> Your computer works the way Microsoft intended for it to work: safely and efficiently. However, there are drawbacks:</p><h3 id="1-You-Can-Only-Get-Apps-From-the-Microsoft-Store"><a href="#1-You-Can-Only-Get-Apps-From-the-Microsoft-Store" class="headerlink" title="1. You Can Only Get Apps From the Microsoft Store"></a>1. You Can Only Get Apps From the Microsoft Store</h3><p> As seen on this <a class="link"   href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/will-linux-distros-run-on-windows-10-s/" >Microsoft Dev Blog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, users of Windows S can only run Modern Universal Windows Platform (UWP) store apps. These are apps that Microsoft developers directly created or verified. Other types of apps delivered through third-party licenses to the Microsoft Store will be unavailable in S mode.</p><h3 id="2-You-Can’t-Use-the-Command-Line-or-Code-Editors"><a href="#2-You-Can’t-Use-the-Command-Line-or-Code-Editors" class="headerlink" title="2. You Can’t Use the Command Line or Code Editors"></a>2. You Can’t Use the Command Line or Code Editors</h3><p> S mode is not for you if you are a developer, hacker, admin, or IT person managing a network of company computers. S mode prevents users from using the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-terminal-vs-powershell/" >Windows Terminal or PowerShell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You can’t use Linux either. The main reason is that these apps run outside the safe environment that protects the operating system from malware. So, VS Code, other <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/9-best-free-code-editors/" >code editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and developer tools are off the table.</p><h3 id="3-The-Windows-Registry-Is-Off-limits"><a href="#3-The-Windows-Registry-Is-Off-limits" class="headerlink" title="3. The Windows Registry Is Off-limits"></a>3. The Windows Registry Is Off-limits</h3><p> Like the command line and code editors, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-the-windows-registry-editor-and-how-do-i-use-it-makeuseof-explains/" >Windows registry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is also off-limits to users in S mode. The registry is a powerful database of configuration settings that lets power users customize Windows to their taste—beyond the regular settings. However, tinkering with the Windows registry can harm your PC, something the clamshell of S mode is designed to prevent.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/regedit.jpg"                      alt="photo of the windows search"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Activate-S-Mode-in-Windows-11"><a href="#How-to-Activate-S-Mode-in-Windows-11" class="headerlink" title="How to Activate S Mode in Windows 11"></a>How to Activate S Mode in Windows 11</h2><p> You can’t activate S mode; it comes pre-installed or shipped with the OS. So, when you get a new laptop, you’ll have the option to use it in S mode when you’re setting it up for the first time. Some computers, like the Surface, come shipped with S mode only, and you don’t get that option to try S mode first.</p><h2 id="How-to-Leave-S-Mode-in-Windows-11"><a href="#How-to-Leave-S-Mode-in-Windows-11" class="headerlink" title="How to Leave S Mode in Windows 11"></a>How to Leave S Mode in Windows 11</h2><p> Before you begin, note that leaving S mode is one-way. You can’t leave and come back.</p><p> That said, the first step is to check if your PC is running S mode in the first place. You can do this by navigating <strong>Windows &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; About</strong>. Your Windows specification will show if you’re running Windows 11 Home in S mode.</p><ol><li>If your PC is indeed running Windows 11 Home in S mode, you can leave by navigating to <strong>Windows &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Activation</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Upgrade your edition of Windows</strong></li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions</li></ol><h2 id="Window-S-Mode-Fast-Secure-but-Limiting"><a href="#Window-S-Mode-Fast-Secure-but-Limiting" class="headerlink" title="Window S Mode: Fast, Secure, but Limiting"></a>Window S Mode: Fast, Secure, but Limiting</h2><p> S mode takes the responsibility of maintaining your cybersecurity off you. You also get a snappy performance from your hardware. This nature makes S mode better suited for people who don’t want to tinker with technology. If you can’t decide still, the good news is you can buy a regular PC and try out S mode. The snag is you can’t go back once you decide to take charge.</p><p> If you’re a Windows user, you should get the complete picture before you get a computer in Windows 11 S mode. So, let’s explore what it is and if it’s for you.</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/boost-your-pcs-safety-with-these-7-password-generators/"><u>Boost Your PC's Safety with These 7 Password Generators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/navigating-win-rpc-failures-five-must-try-fixes/"><u>Navigating Win RPC Failures: Five Must-Try Fixes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/essentials-for-enabling-win11-on-5ghz-networks-effortlessly/"><u>Essentials for Enabling Win11 on 5GHz Networks Effortlessly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/overcoming-unauthorized-user-error-in-windows-1111/"><u>Overcoming Unauthorized User Error in Windows 11/11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/altering-windows-lockout-duration-post-failed-logon/"><u>Altering Windows Lockout Duration Post-Failed Logon</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/refreshing-classic-directx-games-with-dxvk-upgrades/"><u>Refreshing Classic DirectX Games with DXVK Upgrades</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/disabling-update-failure-code-0x80246007-windows-guide/"><u>Disabling Update Failure Code 0X80246007: Windows Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/guide-to-regain-basic-windows-settings-after-restart/"><u>Guide to Regain Basic Windows Settings After Restart</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/consistent-connections-avoiding-disruptions-in-windows/"><u>Consistent Connections: Avoiding Disruptions in Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/overcoming-common-roadblocks-in-windows-app-functionality/"><u>Overcoming Common Roadblocks in Windows App Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-seamless-scene-shifts-in-video-editing/"><u>Updated In 2024, Mastering Seamless Scene Shifts in Video Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mod-video-editor-showdown-the-best-free-options/"><u>New In 2024, MOD Video Editor Showdown The Best Free Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fake-gps-on-android-without-mock-location-for-your-tecno-spark-10-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>How to Fake GPS on Android without Mock Location For your Tecno Spark 10 4G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-instawisdom-100-powerful-caption-examples-for-self-expression/"><u>In 2024, InstaWisdom  100 Powerful Caption Examples for Self-Expression</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-catch-or-beat-sleeping-snorlax-on-pokemon-go-for-gionee-f3-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Catch or Beat Sleeping Snorlax on Pokemon Go For Gionee F3 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-360-fb-live-broadcasts-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Mastering 360 FB Live Broadcasts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-contacts-from-vivo-y28-5g-to-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Contacts from Vivo Y28 5G To Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-cutting-edge-tips-for-outshining-others-in-facebooks-social-space/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Cutting-Edge Tips for Outshining Others in Facebook's Social Space</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/perfect-pairings-of-sound-and-sight-on-social-platforms/"><u>Perfect Pairings of Sound and Sight on Social Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-hunt-and-harvest-game-plan-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Hunt and Harvest Game Plan for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Essential-Techniques-to-Revitalize-Frozen-Spotify-Win11"><a href="#Essential-Techniques-to-Revitalize-Frozen-Spotify-Win11" class="headerlink" title="Essential Techniques to Revitalize Frozen Spotify Win11"></a>Essential Techniques to Revitalize Frozen Spotify Win11</h2><p> Spotify is among the foremost music-streaming apps for Windows. However, some users can’t utilize that software because of a “Spotify application is not responding” error. That error message pops up for some users when they try opening the Spotify app on Windows 10 and 11.</p><p> Spotify doesn’t open when the “application is not responding” error occurs. Although users can’t still utilize Spotify within a browser, that’s not quite the same as the Windows app. This is how you can fix the “Spotify application is not responding” error message on a Windows PC.</p><h2 id="1-Terminate-Background-Spotify-Processes-in-Task-Manager"><a href="#1-Terminate-Background-Spotify-Processes-in-Task-Manager" class="headerlink" title="1. Terminate Background Spotify Processes in Task Manager"></a>1. Terminate Background Spotify Processes in Task Manager</h2><p> Ending Spotify background processes is one of the most straightforward and widely confirmed resolutions for the “application is not responding” error. This error often occurs because a Spotify process is still running in the background. So, the first thing you should do is to terminate all Spotify processes you can find in Task Manager like this:</p><ol><li>Click anywhere on an empty taskbar space with your mouse’s right button to select <strong>Task Manager</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Processes</strong> if Task Manager opens with a different tab.</li><li>If you can see Spotify in the Apps section, right-click that process and select <strong>End task</strong>.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/end-task-option.jpg"                      alt="The End task option"                ></li><li>Go through the background section and disable any Spotify processes you see there by selecting <strong>End task</strong>.</li><li>Exit the Task Manager tool.</li><li>Then right-click a Spotify desktop or Start menu shortcut and select <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</li></ol><h2 id="2-Run-the-Taskkill-Command"><a href="#2-Run-the-Taskkill-Command" class="headerlink" title="2. Run the Taskkill Command"></a>2. Run the Taskkill Command</h2><p> Some Spotify users have said they were able to resolve the “application is not responding” error by running a taskkill command. This is a variation of the above resolution for terminating Spotify processes via the Command Prompt. You can run the taskkill command for Spotify as follows:</p><ol><li>Open the Command Prompt as an administrator (see <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/" >how to open the Command Prompt app with admin rights <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for help).<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/run-as-administrator-option-for-command-prompt.jpg"                      alt="The Run as administrator Command Prompt option"                ></li><li>Input this taskkill command:<br><code>TASKKILL /F /IM spotify.exe</code><br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/taskkill-command.jpg"                      alt="The taskkill command"                ></li><li>Press <strong>Enter</strong> to execute the taskill command.</li></ol><h2 id="3-Delete-the-Spotify-User-Data-Folder"><a href="#3-Delete-the-Spotify-User-Data-Folder" class="headerlink" title="3. Delete the Spotify User Data Folder"></a>3. Delete the Spotify User Data Folder</h2><p> Deleting a -user subfolder within the Spotify data folder is another user-confirmed method for fixing the “Spotify application is not responding” error. Erasing that subfolder will delete the Spotify desktop app’s cached data for songs and login details. This is how you can delete the -user data folder in Windows:</p><ol><li>Open Run by pressing that app’s <strong>Win + R</strong> key combo.</li><li>Type <strong>%appdata%</strong> in Run’s <strong>Open</strong> box and press <strong>Enter</strong> to view a Roaming folder.</li><li>Click the Spotify folder.</li><li>Open the users subfolder within the Spotify directory.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/user-folder.jpg"                      alt="The -user folder"                ></li><li>Right-click on the -user folder with random characters within its directory title and select <strong>Delete</strong>.</li><li>Try opening Spotify again.</li></ol><p> A variation of this potential resolution is to erase a specific Spotify cache file. To do so, you’ll need to open the -user folder. Then right-click the <strong>local-files.bnk</strong> file and select <strong>Delete</strong>.</p><p> If you’re utilizing the UWP app, select the <strong>Reset</strong> option to clear Spotify’s cached data. You can click that <strong>Reset</strong> option within the Apps &amp; Features section of the Windows Settings app. Our guide tells you <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-reset-app/" >how to reset Windows apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="4-Repair-the-Spotify-App"><a href="#4-Repair-the-Spotify-App" class="headerlink" title="4. Repair the Spotify App"></a>4. Repair the Spotify App</h2><p> Users with the UWP Spotify app can also try selecting a <strong>Repair</strong> option. The <strong>Repair</strong> option is available for fixing Microsoft Store apps that aren’t working right. You can select that troubleshooting option for Spotify just below that app’s <strong>Reset</strong> button from its advanced options within the Apps &amp; Features tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/apps-and-features.jpg"                      alt="The Uninstall option"                ></p><h2 id="5-Check-That-Spotify-Is-Allowed-Through-the-Windows-Firewall"><a href="#5-Check-That-Spotify-Is-Allowed-Through-the-Windows-Firewall" class="headerlink" title="5. Check That Spotify Is Allowed Through the Windows Firewall"></a>5. Check That Spotify Is Allowed Through the Windows Firewall</h2><p> A firewall block is another potential cause for the “Spotify application is not responding” error. To address this possible cause, open Windows Defender Firewall’s allowed app settings and select the <strong>Public</strong> and <strong>Private</strong> checkboxes for the Spotify app. Our guide for <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-allow-apps-windows-firewall/" >allowing apps through Windows Defender Firewall <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> includes full instructions for applying this resolution.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/windows-defender-firewall.jpg"                      alt="The Windows Defender Firewall applet"                ></p><p> Many third-party security apps also have firewall components that can feasibly cause the “Spotify application is not responding” error much the same as WDF. If your PC has third-party security software installed, try allowing Spotify through that app’s firewall. Look for firewall exception options in the software’s settings tabs and select to permit Spotify through it.</p><h2 id="6-Disable-Third-Party-Security-Software-Installed"><a href="#6-Disable-Third-Party-Security-Software-Installed" class="headerlink" title="6. Disable Third-Party Security Software Installed"></a>6. Disable Third-Party Security Software Installed</h2><p> Third-party security software packages also have antivirus shields that can cause app startup issues. So, try disabling the antivirus component of any third-party security app installed before running Spotify. This can usually be done by right-clicking the system tray icon of an antivirus tool and selecting a disable or turn-off setting for temporarily deactivating the shield.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/disable-antivirus.jpg"                      alt="Temporarily disable antivirus"                ></p><p> If that works, don’t leave the antivirus shield disabled. Instead, add Spotify to the antivirus software’s scanning exclusion list. Go through the app’s setting tabs to find its antivirus exclusion options.</p><h2 id="7-Reinstall-the-Spotify-App"><a href="#7-Reinstall-the-Spotify-App" class="headerlink" title="7. Reinstall the Spotify App"></a>7. Reinstall the Spotify App</h2><p> Finally, reinstall your Spotify software if the “application is not responding” error persists after applying all the alternative resolutions above. That’s probably the best way to fix other Spotify bugs or corrupted files causing the error. You can uninstall Spotify with the Apps &amp; Features Settings tool, which is one of the methods in our guide to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/" >removing Windows software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/apps-and-features.jpg"                      alt="The Uninstall option"                ></p><p> We also recommend that you eradicate leftover Spotify data before reinstalling. To do so, delete the Spotify data folder at this directory path:</p><p><code>C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Spotify</code></p><p> Or you could utilize a third-party uninstaller to remove Spotify. Software packages like IObit Uninstaller and Advanced Uninstaller Pro are freely available and will eradicate Spotify’s leftover data and registry entries. Check out our article about the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-uninstallers-stubborn-apps/" >best Windows third-party uninstaller software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for further details.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iobit-uninstaller-1.jpg"                      alt="The IObit Uninstaller software"                ></p><p> Then you can reinstall either the UWP or the desktop Spotify app. Click <strong>Download</strong> on the <a class="link"   href="https://www.spotify.com/us/download/windows/" >Spotify Windows download page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get the setup wizard for the desktop software. Then you’ll need to double-click the <strong>SpotifySet.exe</strong> file to install the desktop software.</p><p> If you prefer the UWP Spotify app version, open this <a class="link"   href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/spotify-music-and-podcasts/9NCBCSZSJRSB" >Microsoft Store page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Press the <strong>Get in Store</strong> app button on the Spotify page. Next, select <strong>Open Microsoft Store</strong> on the dialog box that prompts you to install the app from there. Click on Spotify’s <strong>Get</strong> button to both download and install that app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/get-option-for-spotify.jpg"                      alt="The Get option for the Spotify UWP app"                ></p><h2 id="Get-Back-in-the-Groove-With-Your-Spotify-Windows-App"><a href="#Get-Back-in-the-Groove-With-Your-Spotify-Windows-App" class="headerlink" title="Get Back in the Groove With Your Spotify Windows App"></a>Get Back in the Groove With Your Spotify Windows App</h2><p> Those potential solutions will probably kick-start Spotify when the “Spotify application is not responding” stops it from starting. They’re worth a try since they’ve worked for many other Spotify users. Then you can listen to all your favorite albums with the Spotify Windows app again.</p><p> Spotify doesn’t open when the “application is not responding” error occurs. Although users can’t still utilize Spotify within a browser, that’s not quite the same as the Windows app. This is how you can fix the “Spotify application is not responding” error message on a Windows PC.</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/7-ways-to-prevent-unauthorized-access-on-windows/"><u>7 Ways to Prevent Unauthorized Access on Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/fixing-no-connection-issue-on-windows-os/"><u>Fixing No Connection Issue on Windows OS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/handling-the-mysterious-windows-subsystem-for-linux-error-4294967295/"><u>Handling the Mysterious Windows Subsystem for Linux Error 4294967295</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/steps-for-restoring-network-link-in-windows/"><u>Steps for Restoring Network Link in Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/integrating-new-folders-into-windows-11s-menu/"><u>Integrating New Folders Into Windows 11'S Menu</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/1719196389328-resolving-stuck-windows-update-problems-now/"><u>Resolving Stuck Windows Update Problems Now</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/unlock-full-control-in-windows-cmd/"><u>Unlock Full Control in Windows CMD</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/prime-windows-experience-select-top-optimizers-ranked/"><u>Prime Windows Experience: Select Top Optimizers Ranked</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/navigating-through-white-screens-and-blank-logins-on-windows-1011/"><u>Navigating Through White Screens and Blank Logins on Windows 10/11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/1719310047074-overcome-compatibility-issues-with-easy-fixed-steps/"><u>Overcome Compatibility Issues with Easy Fixed Steps.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-flashlight-from-apple-iphone-6-plus-lock-screen-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Remove Flashlight From Apple iPhone 6 Plus Lock Screen | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/radiance-reimagined-top-video-tools-list/"><u>Radiance Reimagined  Top Video Tools List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-google-play-location-on-xiaomi-redmi-k70-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change Google Play Location On Xiaomi Redmi K70 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-navigating-the-maze-a-comprehensive-guide-to-mov-capture-in-win10/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Navigating the Maze  A Comprehensive Guide to MOV Capture in Win10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/what-pokemon-evolve-with-a-dawn-stone-for-vivo-y55s-5g-2023-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>What Pokémon Evolve with A Dawn Stone For Vivo Y55s 5G (2023)? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-will-pokemon-go-ban-the-account-if-you-use-pgsharp-on-poco-c55-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Will Pokémon Go Ban the Account if You Use PGSharp On Poco C55 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/approved-streamline-your-viewing-experience-with-accelerated-or-slowed-videos/"><u>2024 Approved  Streamline Your Viewing Experience with Accelerated or Slowed Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-impeccable-photo-editing-using-the-virtual-background-effect-on-instagram/"><u>[New] Impeccable Photo Editing Using the Virtual Background Effect on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-finding-the-best-solutions/"><u>New 2024 Approved How To Fix Slow Playback Issues in DaVinci Resolve Finding the Best Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/4-most-known-ways-to-find-someone-on-tinder-for-apple-iphone-xs-by-name-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>4 Most-Known Ways to Find Someone on Tinder For Apple iPhone XS by Name | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Strategies-to-Overcome-WindowsApps-Protection-Measures"><a href="#Strategies-to-Overcome-WindowsApps-Protection-Measures" class="headerlink" title="Strategies to Overcome WindowsApps Protection Measures"></a>Strategies to Overcome WindowsApps Protection Measures</h2><p> The Windows Operating System has a hidden folder called “WindowsApps.” It stores Microsoft application files and other important files to enhance your Windows experience. The folder usually contains a large amount of reusable space. This is because it also contains those application files you uninstalled from your PC earlier.</p><p> Thankfully, you can remove unnecessary files from the WindowsApps folder to free up some space. But it’s a little hard to get to this folder because it’s protected and hidden in Windows File Explorer. Here are some ways to access the WindowsApps Folder on Windows and make necessary changes to it.</p><h2 id="What-Is-the-WindowsApps-Folder"><a href="#What-Is-the-WindowsApps-Folder" class="headerlink" title="What Is the WindowsApps Folder?"></a>What Is the WindowsApps Folder?</h2><p> You can find the WindowsApps folder under the <strong>C:\Program Files</strong> directory in Windows 10 and 11. This folder has all the files related to UWP packages or Windows apps that you get from the Microsoft Store or that come preinstalled on Windows OS.</p><p> The problem is that a basic Windows user or even a system administrator user account can’t access or change the files in the folder. This is because it is owned by a Microsoft account named “TrustedInstaller.” We’ve already covered <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-trustedinstaller-and-why-does-it-keep-me-from-renaming-files/" >everything about TrustedInstaller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and how to disable it in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WindowsApps-Hidden-Folder.jpg"                      alt="WindowsApps Hidden Folder In Explorer"                ></p><p> Even if you uninstall or debloat some of the apps on Windows, the core application files are not removed from the WindowsApps folder. So, there are chances that such apps will reappear after a new Windows update.</p><p> This is why we recommend using one of the <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-uninstallers-stubborn-apps/" >popular software uninstallers for Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Because these tools not only uninstall an app completely but also clean up any leftovers and traces from all the secured folders.</p><p> If you don’t know what you’re doing—modifying or deleting the files in the WindowsApps folder could cause system errors or even cause the Windows operating system to crash.</p><p> There are many ways to access the WindowsApps folder and bypass the protection to gain access to the necessary files.</p><h2 id="Method-1-How-to-Access-WindowsApps-via-File-Explorer"><a href="#Method-1-How-to-Access-WindowsApps-via-File-Explorer" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. How to Access WindowsApps via File Explorer"></a>Method 1. How to Access WindowsApps via File Explorer</h2><p> You can easily find the WindowsApps folder in the Windows File Explorer by unhiding the respective folder first. However, to access the folder and make changes to the files—you need to gain some extra rights by changing the ownership.</p><p> Follow these steps to view the WindowsApps folder first:</p><ol><li>Open the Windows File Explorer (<strong>Win + E</strong>) and go to the <strong>C:\Program Files</strong> directory.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Program-Files-Directory-In-Explorer.jpg"                      alt="Program Files Directory In Explorer"                ></li><li>Now, click the <strong>View</strong> options button at the top of the File Explorer.</li><li>Click or hover over the <strong>Show</strong> button and select the <strong>Hidden items</strong> option to enable it.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/file-explorer-view-options.jpg"                      alt="File Explorer View Options"                ></li></ol><p> That’s it. Now, you can see theWindowsApps folder in the same directory.</p><p> If you try to open it, you’ll see an information popup saying, “You have been denied permission.” So, to actually access that folder and gain exclusive read and write rights—you’ve got to do a bit more.</p><h3 id="Change-Ownership-Properties-to-Get-Access"><a href="#Change-Ownership-Properties-to-Get-Access" class="headerlink" title="Change Ownership Properties to Get Access"></a>Change Ownership Properties to Get Access</h3><p> For the next steps, you need a user account with administrative rights.

So, it becomes essential for you to access this folder once and check for the files that you no longer need.</p><p> Moreover, you can also check out some <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/take-ownership-of-windows-files-and-folders-with-these-tools/" >free tools for taking control of files and folders <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on Windows. Such tools allow you to take full ownership of all your files and folders with a single click.</p><h2 id="Method-2-How-to-Access-WindowsApps-via-a-PowerShell-Command"><a href="#Method-2-How-to-Access-WindowsApps-via-a-PowerShell-Command" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. How to Access WindowsApps via a PowerShell Command"></a>Method 2. How to Access WindowsApps via a PowerShell Command</h2><p> The File Explorer-based method is pretty complicated for a newbie. Use PowerShell to complete your job if you’re looking for an easy-to-go method. Using Windows PowerShell is a pretty straightforward and automated way of doing the same thing.</p><p> Follow these steps to access the WindowsApps folder using PowerShell:</p><p> 1. Launch the Windows start menu or Windows search by pressing <strong>Win + Q</strong>.</p><p> 2. Type in <strong>PowerShell</strong> and click the <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> option to run PowerShell with administrator rights. Besides, you must also know some other <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-command-prompt-powershell/" >ways to open PowerShell on Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for future usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PowerShell-In-Windows-Search.jpg"                      alt="PowerShell In Windows Search"                ></p><p> 4. In Powershell, run the following command and press the Enter key:</p><p><code>takeown /f &amp;ldquo;C:\Program Files\WindowsApps&amp;rdquo; /r</code></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Change-Ownership-Command-In-Shell.jpg"                      alt="Change Ownership Command In Shell"                ></p><p> The above command will restore all the files or folder ownership to the system administrator. It will take some time for your administrator user account to become the owner of the WindowsApps folder and everything in it.</p><p> The access you gain by executing the above process is similar to that of the Windows File Explorer-based method. You have just automated the process and eliminated the unhiding of system files. Now, you can back up, clear some space, or make changes to the Windows apps’ back-end files.</p><p> If you’re facing crashes while executing the file, make sure to check out some <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/windows-powershell-has-stopped-working-error-fix/" >effective ways to fix PowerShell crash errors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="3-How-to-Access-WindowsApps-via-a-Registry-Hack"><a href="#3-How-to-Access-WindowsApps-via-a-Registry-Hack" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Access WindowsApps via a Registry Hack"></a>3. How to Access WindowsApps via a Registry Hack</h2><p> There’s another quick way to do the same thing with just a few steps. If you cannot use the PowerShell method stated above, you can use a simple registry hack to access the files in one go.</p><p> Here’s how you can take full ownership of the context menu for your files and folders and get to the WindowsApps folder:</p><ol><li>Download the <a class="link"   href="https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/take%5Ffull%5Fownership%5Fof%5Ffiles%5Ffolders%5Fregistry%5Fhack.html" >Take Ownership registry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> file.</li><li>Extract the zip and open the <strong>Add Take Ownership to Context menu</strong> registry file.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Take-Ownership-Registry-File.jpg"                      alt="Take Ownership Registry File In Explorer"                ></li><li>On the next screen, click <strong>Yes</strong> to add it to the registry.</li><li>Next, exit the popup by clicking <strong>OK</strong> and navigate to the <strong>C:\Program Files</strong> directory.</li><li>Select the <strong>WindowsApps</strong> folder and right-click on it.</li><li>From the context menu, click the <strong>Take Ownership</strong> option.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Take-Ownership-Context-Menu.jpg"                      alt="Take Ownership Context Menu"                ></li><li>In the Command Prompt, you must <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/user-account-control-windows-10/" >give User Account Control Administrator rights <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for the registry hack to work. After that, please wait a few minutes for the window to close. Soon, it will display success messages constantly in the Command Prompt.</li></ol><p> Once finished, you’ll no longer face the “You’ve been denied permission” error on clicking the WindowsApps folder.</p><h2 id="Enjoy-Unrestricted-Access-to-the-WindowsApps-Folder"><a href="#Enjoy-Unrestricted-Access-to-the-WindowsApps-Folder" class="headerlink" title="Enjoy Unrestricted Access to the WindowsApps Folder"></a>Enjoy Unrestricted Access to the WindowsApps Folder</h2><p> Using one of the provided methods, you should now be able to view the hidden files and folders inside the WindowsApps folder. Now that you know everything about it, you can easily make changes to the UWP packages that are safe.</p><p> Moreover, in the WindowsApps folder—you can remove Windows app remnants, open any software directly from the .EXE file, and inspect all removed packages, among other things.</p><p> The Windows Operating System has a hidden folder called “WindowsApps.” It stores Microsoft application files and other important files to enhance your Windows experience. The folder usually contains a large amount of reusable space. This is because it also contains those application files you uninstalled from your PC earlier.</p><p> Thankfully, you can remove unnecessary files from the WindowsApps folder to free up some space. But it’s a little hard to get to this folder because it’s protected and hidden in Windows File Explorer. Here are some ways to access the WindowsApps Folder on Windows and make necessary changes to it.</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/unveiling-pcs-global-ip-address-with-terminal-commands/"><u>Unveiling PC's Global IP Address with Terminal Commands</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/tackling-windows-vds-failures-head-on/"><u>Tackling Windows VDS Failures Head-On</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/fixing-inactive-voice-over-on-microsofts-document-reader/"><u>Fixing Inactive Voice-Over on Microsoft's Document Reader</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/ensuring-your-windows-pcs-character-map-functionality-succeeds/"><u>Ensuring Your Windows PC's Character Map Functionality Succeeds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/maximize-productivity-configuring-multimonitors-in-win11/"><u>Maximize Productivity: Configuring Multimonitors in Win11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/steps-to-overcome-windows-compatibility-with-photoshop/"><u>Steps to Overcome Windows Compatibility with Photoshop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/advanced-guide-to-full-battery-indicators-in-win-oses/"><u>Advanced Guide to Full Battery Indicators in Win OSes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-from-screens-to-gifs-the-art-of-converting-vimeo-footage/"><u>[New] In 2024, From Screens to Gifs  The Art of Converting Vimeo Footage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-translation.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-easily-use-korean-to-english-video-translators/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved How To Easily Use Korean to English Video Translators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://animation-videos.techidaily.com/updated-whiteboard-animation-services-top-15-animation-companies-to-pick/"><u>Updated Whiteboard Animation Services Top 15 Animation Companies to Pick</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-a-look-into-magix-graphic-designer/"><u>[New] A Look Into MAGIX Graphic Designer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-inshot-evaluation-how-it-stacks-up-in-editing-arena/"><u>In 2024, InShot Evaluation  How It Stacks Up in Editing Arena?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-10-indispensable-instagram-video-editing-apps-for-marketers-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] 10 Indispensable Instagram Video Editing Apps for Marketers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/privacy-purposed-selecting-best-insta-watchers/"><u>Privacy-Purposed  Selecting Best Insta Watchers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-beyond-sharex-in-depth-comparisons/"><u>In 2024, Beyond ShareX  In-Depth Comparisons</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

At times, Steam may fail to open on Windows and display the “Failed to Load steamui.dll” error instead.</p><p> If this has happened to you, don’t panic. Here are some effective ways to resolve the annoying error message.</p><h2 id="Bypass-the-“Failed-to-Load-steamui-dll”-Error-in-Steam-With-a-Quick-Workaround"><a href="#Bypass-the-“Failed-to-Load-steamui-dll”-Error-in-Steam-With-a-Quick-Workaround" class="headerlink" title="Bypass the “Failed to Load steamui.dll” Error in Steam With a Quick Workaround"></a>Bypass the “Failed to Load steamui.dll” Error in Steam With a Quick Workaround</h2><p> If you need to access Steam quickly and don’t have time to figure out what’s causing the error, it’s possible to bypass Steam’s “Failed to Load steamui.dll” error with a workaround. Simply open Steam and wait for the error message to appear. This time, instead of closing the error message, double-click Steam’s shortcut to open it again. The Steam client should start checking for updates and open as usual.</p><p> Of course, this is just a temporary fix. If you are looking to resolve the “Failed to Load steamui.dll” error for good, employ the following solutions.</p><h2 id="1-Restart-the-Steam-Client"><a href="#1-Restart-the-Steam-Client" class="headerlink" title="1. Restart the Steam Client"></a>1. Restart the Steam Client</h2><p> At times, Steam may encounter issues while launching and fail to load its graphical user interface (GUI) on Windows. As Steam is already running in the background, repeated attempts to open the app may prove fruitless and result in the “Failed to Load steamui.dll” error. To fix this, you can try closing the Steam client completely <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-windows-task-manager/" >using the Task Manager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and reopening it.</p><p> Press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Esc</strong> to open the Task Manager. In the <strong>Processes</strong> tab, right-click on <strong>Steam</strong> and select the <strong>End task</strong> option from the context menu.

Delete the SteamUI.dll and libswscale-x.dll Files</h2><p> If restarting the Steam client does not help, it’s likely that the SteamUI.dll and the libswscale-x.dll files on your system have become corrupted. If that’s the case, you will need to remove these files manually. Doing so will force Steam to download fresh copies of these DLL files the next time you open it.</p><ol><li>Right-click on the <strong>Steam</strong> shortcut on your desktop and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Under the <strong>Shortcut</strong> tab, click the <strong>Open File Location</strong> button.</li><li>In the File Explorer window that opens, locate and select the <strong>SteamUI.dll</strong> and <strong>libswscale-x.dll</strong> files.</li><li>Click the <strong>trash icon</strong> at the top to delete them.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/steamui-file-in-file-explorer.jpg"                      alt="SteamUI File in File Explorer"                ></li></ol><p> Reopen Steam after this and see if you get any errors.</p><h2 id="3-Delete-the-Beta-File-From-Steam-Directory"><a href="#3-Delete-the-Beta-File-From-Steam-Directory" class="headerlink" title="3. Delete the Beta File From Steam Directory"></a>3. Delete the Beta File From Steam Directory</h2><p> Are you using the beta version of the Steam client? If so, you are likely to experience such errors while using Steam on Windows.</p><p> Since you can not open Steam, you won’t be able to leave the beta program via the in-app settings menu. Fortunately, there’s another way to exit Steam’s beta program and switch to the stable version of the app. Here are the steps for the same.</p><ol><li>Press <strong>Win + E</strong> to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/" >open File Explorer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li>Navigate to the directory where you have installed Steam.</li><li>Double-click the <strong>package</strong> folder to open it.</li><li>Locate the <strong>Beta</strong> file within the folder and delete it.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/delete-steam-beta-file-on-windows.jpg"                      alt="Delete Steam Beta File on Windows"                ></li></ol><p> Restart your PC after this and try to open Steam again. It should download the necessary files to switch to the stable version of the app, and the “Failed to Load steamui.dll” error should not appear.</p><h2 id="4-Clear-Steam-Download-Cache"><a href="#4-Clear-Steam-Download-Cache" class="headerlink" title="4. Clear Steam Download Cache"></a>4. Clear Steam Download Cache</h2><p> Corrupt or inaccessible download caches can also affect Steam’s performance on Windows and lead to such errors. You can try clearing Steam’s download cache to see if that helps. Here’s how to do it.</p><ol><li>Open Steam on your PC.</li><li>Click the <strong>Steam</strong> menu in the top left corner and select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Downloads</strong> from the left sidebar.</li><li>Click the <strong>Clear Download Cache</strong> button on your right.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/clear-steam-download-cache.jpg"                      alt="Clear Steam Download Cache"                ></li></ol><h2 id="5-Reset-Steam-Configuration-Settings"><a href="#5-Reset-Steam-Configuration-Settings" class="headerlink" title="5.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Guidelines-for-Upholding-Windows-Date-Time-Integrity"><a href="#Guidelines-for-Upholding-Windows-Date-Time-Integrity" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines for Upholding Windows Date&#x2F;Time Integrity"></a>Guidelines for Upholding Windows Date&#x2F;Time Integrity</h2><p> You’re using your Windows device and notice something strange in the date and time settings. Someone has changed the settings without your knowledge or permission. This makes it difficult to stay on schedule with tasks and activities. In this guide, we’ll show how to stop anonymous users from changing date and time settings on Windows computers.</p><h2 id="How-To-Prevent-Users-From-Changing-the-Date-and-Time-on-Windows"><a href="#How-To-Prevent-Users-From-Changing-the-Date-and-Time-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="How To Prevent Users From Changing the Date and Time on Windows"></a>How To Prevent Users From Changing the Date and Time on Windows</h2><p> There are two ways to prevent users from changing Windows date and time. The first is to use Group Policy Editor, a system administration tool designed to control computer behavior in an organization. While the second way is to use Registry Editor, which allows you to modify Windows registry settings.</p><p> For both methods, you need administrative access to the computer to change it. Once you’ve made the changes, nobody can alter the date and time settings. Let’s look at each method in more detail.</p><h2 id="1-Use-the-Group-Policy-Editor"><a href="#1-Use-the-Group-Policy-Editor" class="headerlink" title="1. Use the Group Policy Editor"></a>1. Use the Group Policy Editor</h2><p> If your computer is part of an organization and users often change the date and time, use Group Policy Editor to stop it. This will prevent those with limited access to the computer from altering the date and time. However, this method only works for Windows Pro, Enterprise, or Education Editions.</p><p> So, if you have Windows Home Edition, this won’t work. In that case, you must first <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/" >activate the Group Policy Editor for Windows Home <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. If it seems complicated, skip it and try the next solution instead.</p><p> Follow these steps to prevent users from changing the date and time:</p><ol><li>Press <strong>Win + R</strong> on your keyboard to open the Run window.</li><li>Type <strong>gpedit.msc</strong> in the text box and press Enter. This will open the Group Policy Editor window.</li><li>On the left side of the window, navigate to the following path:<br>Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; System &gt; Locale Services</li><li>In the right-side pane, double-click on <strong>Disallow user override of locale settings</strong>.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/disallow-user-override-of-locale-settings.jpg"                      alt="Disallow user override of locale settings"                ></li><li>In the pop-up window, check the <strong>Enabled</strong> radio button.</li><li>Then click <strong>Apply</strong> &gt; <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</li></ol><p> This will block anyone from changing the date and time settings on your computer. However, if you have administrative access to the computer, you can still alter the settings.</p><p> If you want to revert to the default settings later, open Group Policy Editor again and change the value of Disallow user override of locale settings back to Not Configured or Disabled. This way, users can change the time and date again.</p><h2 id="2-Tweak-the-Registry-Editor"><a href="#2-Tweak-the-Registry-Editor" class="headerlink" title="2. Tweak the Registry Editor"></a>2. Tweak the Registry Editor</h2><p> If you’re using Windows Home Edition or have disabled the Group Policy Editor, use the Registry Editor to protect date and time settings. This method is more advanced and has a higher risk of system damage.</p><p> In that case, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/" >back up your Windows registry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before changing it. Doing so will restore settings if something goes wrong.</p><p> Follow these steps to stop users from changing the time and date via the registry:</p><ol><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/" >Open the Run command dialog box <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li>Type <strong>regedit</strong> in the field and press Enter. This will <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-registry-editor/" >open the Registry Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li>In the Registry Editor window, navigate to the following path:<br>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Control Panel\International\</li><li>If the International folder doesn’t exist, create one. To do that, right-click on Control Panel and select <strong>New</strong> &gt; <strong>Key</strong>. Name it <strong>International</strong>.</li><li>Then right-click on <strong>International</strong> and select New &gt; DWORD (32-bit) Value.</li><li>Name the newly created value <strong>PreventUserOverrides</strong>.</li><li>Double-click on the <strong>PreventUserOverrides</strong> DWORD value.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/use-registry-editor-to-prevent-users-from-chaning-date-and-time-settings.jpg"                      alt="Use Registry Editor to Prevent Users From Chaning date and time settings"                ></li><li>In the pop-up window, change the Value data to <strong>1</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol><p> Once you’ve made the changes, close the Registry Editor window and restart your computer.</p><p> To undo this restriction, delete the <strong>PreventUserOverrides</strong> DWORD value from the registry or change the value to <strong>0</strong>. Doing so will enable users to change the time and date again.</p><h2 id="Stop-Windows-Time-and-Date-Changes"><a href="#Stop-Windows-Time-and-Date-Changes" class="headerlink" title="Stop Windows Time and Date Changes"></a>Stop Windows Time and Date Changes</h2><p> Now stop unauthorized users from changing the date and time settings on your Windows computer. This keeps your tasks and activities on track. If necessary, you can always undo this restriction.</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/cortanas-farewell-windows-future-awaits/"><u>Cortana's Farewell, Windows' Future Awaits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/the-compreenas-guide-track-down-your-windows-serial-number/"><u>The Compreenas Guide: Track Down Your Windows Serial Number</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/windows-mastering-app-and-browser-oversight/"><u>Windows: Mastering App & Browser Oversight</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-windows-key-activation-issues/"><u>Troubleshooting Windows Key Activation Issues</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-a-faulty-esc-key-in-windows-10-and-beyond/"><u>Troubleshoot a Faulty Esc Key in Windows 10 and Beyond</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/customizing-the-summary-size-of-your-pics/"><u>Customizing the Summary Size of Your Pics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/mastering-samsung-flow-linking-winpc-and-galaxy-device/"><u>Mastering Samsung Flow: Linking WinPC & Galaxy Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-maximizing-facebook-video-engagement-with-the-right-cover-size/"><u>New 2024 Approved Maximizing Facebook Video Engagement with the Right Cover Size</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/rhythm-renders-infusing-sound-into-your-visual-storytelling-fb/"><u>Rhythm Renders  Infusing Sound Into Your Visual Storytelling (FB)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-transforming-google-meet-screens-on-devices/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Transforming Google Meet Screens on Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-oppo-reno-11-5g-android-system-webview-crash-2024-issue-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Fix Oppo Reno 11 5G Android System Webview Crash 2024 Issue | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-unstable-footage-fix-it-with-these-top-5-free-android-video-stabilizer-apps/"><u>New Unstable Footage?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Bypass-Windows-Update-Error-Codes-A-Step-by-Step-Approach"><a href="#How-to-Bypass-Windows-Update-Error-Codes-A-Step-by-Step-Approach" class="headerlink" title="How to Bypass Windows Update Error Codes: A Step-by-Step Approach"></a>How to Bypass Windows Update Error Codes: A Step-by-Step Approach</h2><p> The update error 0xC1900101 – 0x30017 pops up when the users try to either install a system update or upgrade to the latest Windows version. There can be a number of reasons behind this issue, such as insufficient space for the update, antivirus installation, and corruption issues within the system.</p><p> The following sections discuss the possible causes and troubleshooting methods for this error. Select the troubleshooting method that is most appropriate for your situation and proceed with it.</p><h2 id="What-Causes-the-0xC1900101-–-0x30017-Error"><a href="#What-Causes-the-0xC1900101-–-0x30017-Error" class="headerlink" title="What Causes the 0xC1900101 – 0x30017 Error?"></a>What Causes the 0xC1900101 – 0x30017 Error?</h2><p> Here are some common reasons behind the update error under consideration:</p><ul><li><strong>Insufficient space</strong> - You must have at least 16 GB of free space to upgrade to the latest version of Windows. If you have insufficient space on your computer, you can try removing the unnecessary, junk files to make space for the upgrade.</li><li><strong>Antivirus interruption</strong> - Your third-party antivirus program or Windows Defender might be blocking the update as a result of a false alarm. If this scenario is applicable, you can try disabling or uninstalling the program to fix the problem.</li><li><strong>Corrupt system files</strong> - The essential system or update files can be facing a corruption issue, which is leading to the update installation failure. Later in this guide, we discuss a couple of methods you can try to resolve these bugs and generic corruption errors.</li><li><strong>Outdated drivers</strong> - All the installed drivers should be up-to-date for the system to successfully upgrade. It is best to look for outdated drivers in the Device Manager and upgrade them before you attempt to install the updates.</li><li><strong>Outdated BIOS</strong> - Your BIOS itself might be outdated, affecting your system’s functioning and causing issues like the update error. In most cases, if your BIOS is outdated or faulty, you will also face common issues like a Blue Screen of Death.</li></ul><p> Now that we know about the potential causes of the issue, let’s take a look at the solutions you can try to resolve the problem. Before proceeding, we recommend that you remove any unnecessary external peripherals like USB from your computer.</p><h2 id="1-Free-Up-Storage-Space"><a href="#1-Free-Up-Storage-Space" class="headerlink" title="1. Free Up Storage Space"></a>1. Free Up Storage Space</h2><p> As we mentioned earlier, you must have at least 16 GB of free space on your system to install new updates. If you do not have storage space, the best way to clear it is by deleting the unnecessary apps and programs you have installed on your computer.</p><p> Apart from that, it also will be a good idea to remove the previous installation files from the system. In addition to clearing the space, this will also solve any interruption issues that these previous installation files may cause during the upgrade process. In case you are using two SSDs on your computer, remove one and then try installing the update.</p><p> Head over to our guide on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-free-up-storage-space/" >different methods of freeing up storage space in Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more information.</p><h2 id="2-Uninstall-Your-Antivirus"><a href="#2-Uninstall-Your-Antivirus" class="headerlink" title="2. Uninstall Your Antivirus"></a>2. Uninstall Your Antivirus</h2><p> If you are using a third-party antivirus program on your computer, it may be blocking the system’s process of installing updates. The solution in this case is simple, as all that you need to do is disable or uninstall the security program temporarily.</p><p> Below, we have discussed the steps of disabling the antivirus using Avast. The steps for your antivirus program might differ slightly.</p><p>Here is how you can do that:</p><ol><li>Right-click on the<strong>antivirus program icon</strong> in the taskbar.</li><li>Choose<strong>Shields control</strong> &gt;<strong>Disable until the computer is restarted</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/disable-antivirus.jpg"                      alt="Temporarily disable antivirus"                ></li></ol><p> If you are not using a third-party security program, you can try<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-turn-off-windows-defender/" >disabling Windows Defender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well. However, we highly recommend that you enable it back after installing the update. Keeping it disabled for a long time can expose your system to risks and potential threats.</p><h2 id="3-Rule-Out-Corruption-Issues"><a href="#3-Rule-Out-Corruption-Issues" class="headerlink" title="3. Rule Out Corruption Issues"></a>3. Rule Out Corruption Issues</h2><p> The next thing that we recommend doing is scanning the system for corruption issues using the built-in troubleshooting utilities in Windows.</p><p> To fix this, we will be using the Windows update troubleshooter, System File Checker, and DISM to find potential issues. Additionally, these utilities will resolve most of the problems they find on their own.</p><h3 id="3-1-Use-the-Windows-Update-Troubleshooter"><a href="#3-1-Use-the-Windows-Update-Troubleshooter" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Use the Windows Update Troubleshooter"></a>3.1 Use the Windows Update Troubleshooter</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static0.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/windows-update-troubleshooter.jpg"                      alt="Run the Windows Update troubleshooter"                ></p><p> You can run the Windows Update troubleshooter via Windows Settings. Instructions on how to run the troubleshooter can be found in our guide on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-update-stuck/" >how to fix Windows Update getting stuck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Once the troubleshooter has finished scanning, check if any issues are identified. If so, the troubleshooter will recommend fixes that can resolve the issue. Click on<strong>Apply this fix</strong> to proceed. In case the utility fails to identify the issues, click on Close the troubleshooter and move to the next method below.</p><h3 id="3-2-Run-SFC-and-DISM-Scans"><a href="#3-2-Run-SFC-and-DISM-Scans" class="headerlink" title="3.2 Run SFC and DISM Scans"></a>3.2 Run SFC and DISM Scans</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static0.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/SFC-and-DISM-Scan.jpg"                      alt="SFC and DISM Scan"                ></p><p> The next thing that you should do is run the SFC and DISM scans via Command Prompt.

DISM, on the other hand, is responsible for repairing a corrupt system image.</p><p> Hopefully, if the system cannot install updates because of corruption issues, these tools will eliminate the problem.</p><h2 id="4-Update-Your-Drivers"><a href="#4-Update-Your-Drivers" class="headerlink" title="4. Update Your Drivers"></a>4. Update Your Drivers</h2><p> Ideally, your drivers must be kept up-to-date at all times for the system to function smoothly. To check if there are any outdated drivers on your system, head over to the Device Manager utility.</p><p> Expand all sections, and look for any drivers with a yellow exclamation mark. This sign indicates that the driver is either outdated or corrupt. Once you have identified a faulty driver, right-click on it and choose<strong>Update driver</strong> &gt;<strong>Search the system for drivers</strong> .</p><p> Wait for the update process of the driver complete and check if the issue is resolved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/keyboard-update-driver.jpg"                      alt="Update the relevant driver"                ></p><p> If you don’t see any exclamation marks, or you don’t think Windows managed to do a good enough job, check out<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-best-free-driver-updaters/" >the best free driver updaters for Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="5-Update-Your-BIOS"><a href="#5-Update-Your-BIOS" class="headerlink" title="5.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Can’t-Open-EXE-Files-on-Windows-Try-These-Fixes"><a href="#Can’t-Open-EXE-Files-on-Windows-Try-These-Fixes" class="headerlink" title="Can’t Open EXE Files on Windows? Try These Fixes"></a>Can’t Open EXE Files on Windows? Try These Fixes</h2><p> EXE files are most commonly used for installing and running programs on Windows computers. So a problem with running your EXE files means you are now stuck in a deadlock—you can’t either run a program nor can you install a new application.</p><p> Luckily, like most Windows errors, the problems with your EXE files can be fixed through several methods. So let’s jump right in and look at all the solutions.</p><h2 id="Can’t-Open-EXE-Files-Here’s-a-List-of-Possible-Causes"><a href="#Can’t-Open-EXE-Files-Here’s-a-List-of-Possible-Causes" class="headerlink" title="Can’t Open EXE Files? Here’s a List of Possible Causes"></a>Can’t Open EXE Files? Here’s a List of Possible Causes</h2><p> While the Windows operating system has gradually improved to move towards a smoother performance, it’s certainly not free from the all bugs that still happen from time to time. Errors like those of EXE files on your PC are part of such errors. And, like most errors, problems with EXE files can arise because of various issues. Here are a few of them:</p><p><strong>1. Malware:</strong> Malware has caused all sorts of problems on Windows since time immemorial, and will most likely continue to do in the future as well. In some cases, therefore, it’s possible that your EXE files have become plagued by malware and hence the problem with opening them.</p><p><strong>2. Group Policy Problems:</strong> Groups Policy is a largely unknown feature on Windows but a very integral one nonetheless. It lets you control and manage the operating system, applications, and user settings in your Active Directory environment.</p><p><strong>3. Wrong File Associations:</strong> Sometimes applications get slapped with associations that don’t make sense. So if a file has been wrongly associated in the EXE file format, it will not work.</p><p><strong>4. Problems With File System:</strong> If there’s some underlying problem with your file system, then the files required for running an EXE file will not work.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-Your-EXE-Files-to-Open-Again"><a href="#How-to-Get-Your-EXE-Files-to-Open-Again" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Your EXE Files to Open Again"></a>How to Get Your EXE Files to Open Again</h2><p> Like the case for most Windows errors, you can’t pinpoint the exact cause of the EXE file errors. But, what we can do is take educated guesses and then try out a host of different methods to get everything working again. So let’s start with the most simple method that will help you open your EXE files once again.</p><h2 id="1-Restart-Your-PC"><a href="#1-Restart-Your-PC" class="headerlink" title="1. Restart Your PC"></a>1. Restart Your PC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/windows-restart.jpg"                      alt="windows restart"                ></p><p> The simplest solutions are often the most overlooked ones. If there was ever a saying that was made for Windows Restart, it would be this one. Because a simple reboot clears away your memory occupied by various apps, it can solve a host of problems that might otherwise keep plaguing your PC.</p><h2 id="2-Rectify-Your-File-Association-Settings"><a href="#2-Rectify-Your-File-Association-Settings" class="headerlink" title="2. Rectify Your File Association Settings"></a>2. Rectify Your File Association Settings</h2><p> If some of your files are plagued by incorrect file associations, then rectifying them can get your EXE files to open up and work as normal again. Don’t get panicked by the complicated name—it’s a fairly simple process. Here’s how you can get started:</p><ul><li>Right-click on the executable file and select <strong>Open with &gt; Choose another app</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>More apps</strong> and select the <strong>Always use this app to open EXE files</strong> checkbox.</li><li>Then choose the Windows Command Processor or Windows Explorer as the default app.</li></ul><h2 id="3-Use-the-Registry-Editor"><a href="#3-Use-the-Registry-Editor" class="headerlink" title="3. Use the Registry Editor"></a>3. Use the Registry Editor</h2><p> Couldn’t fix the file associations with the above method? No worries—the Registry Editor will help you get things fixed. The <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-the-windows-registry-editor-and-how-do-i-use-it-makeuseof-explains/" >Registry Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a Windows tool that lets you check and manage a host of changes to your registry, and with it, other configuration settings on your Windows PC.</p><p> So with a few tweaks here and there in your Registry, you will be able to access your EXE files in no time once again. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Head to the <strong>Start menu</strong> search bar, type in ‘registry editor,’ and select the best match.</li><li>Now to the following path on the Registry Editor:<br><code>Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</code></li><li>Scroll down and click on the EXE registry.</li><li>Now double-click on the <strong>Default</strong> registry and set the <strong>Value Data</strong> as <strong>exefile</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>OK</strong> to save your changes.</li><li>Now, head to the following address on your Editor:<br><code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\exefile\shell\open\command</code></li><li>Click on <strong>Command</strong>. Then right-click on <strong>Default</strong> and set its <strong>Value Data</strong> to <strong>“%1” %*</strong>.</li><li>Finally, click on <strong>OK</strong> to save changes.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/registry-editor-1.jpg"                      alt="registry editor"                ></p><p> Do this and give your PC a quick reboot—you should be able to open your EXE files comfortably after this.</p><h2 id="4-Check-Account-Permissions"><a href="#4-Check-Account-Permissions" class="headerlink" title="4. Check Account Permissions"></a>4. Check Account Permissions</h2><p> Like most operating systems, Windows also uses an account permission model that gives or limits your access or privileges as an account user. It puts on an upper limit on what you can or cannot do with your Windows files.</p><p> So if you’re using a guest account with limited accessibility or your computer is controlled by administrators in an organization, then your privileges might be severely limited.</p><p> One of the ways to limit account privileges is by restricting access to certain files or programs. In your case, your access to EXE files might have been intentionally limited by someone. So if you’re in an official environment or using someone else’s PC, ask your PC administrators to give you access to the EXE files on the computer.</p><h2 id="5-Change-Your-User-Account"><a href="#5-Change-Your-User-Account" class="headerlink" title="5. Change Your User Account"></a>5. Change Your User Account</h2><p> Continuing our point on accounts and permissions from above, we recommend changing your user account. Because of simple restrictions and permission-related limitations, it often happens that you might not be able to do certain actions. In such cases, simply switching your user account can solve a host of problems.</p><p> Click on the <strong>Start menu</strong> search bar and right-click on <strong>Sign-out</strong>. Now wait a few minutes until you’ve successfully signed out of your PC and are back to your sign-in screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/sign-in-screen.jpg"                      alt="sign-in screen"                ></p><p> From there, click on a new user account, get signed in, and then try to run your EXE file once again.</p><h2 id="6-Run-a-Malware-Scan"><a href="#6-Run-a-Malware-Scan" class="headerlink" title="6. Run a Malware Scan"></a>6. Run a Malware Scan</h2><p> Malware can cause a horde of issues on your Windows, and problems with your EXE files is just one of them. If you suspect malware is causing you these troubles, then a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-defender-scan-file-folder/" >quick scan with Microsoft Defender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can fix things for you.</p><h2 id="All-the-Ways-to-Fix-Your-EXE-Files"><a href="#All-the-Ways-to-Fix-Your-EXE-Files" class="headerlink" title="All the Ways to Fix Your EXE Files"></a>All the Ways to Fix Your EXE Files</h2><p> Getting hit by a “can’t open this type of file” error message can certainly be a pain. However, try out the methods from above, and you’d be more than likely to get rid of this error for good. On the off chance that the errors persist, we recommend a full-blown Factory reset as the last resort.</p><p> Luckily, like most Windows errors, the problems with your EXE files can be fixed through several methods. So let’s jump right in and look at all the solutions.</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/augmenting-dedicated-ram-win-11-edition-guide/"><u>Augmenting Dedicated RAM: Win 11 Edition Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/fixing-unchecked-cpu-usage-by-wmi-worker/"><u>Fixing Unchecked Cpu Usage by WMI Worker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/discover-your-ip-command-prompt-guide-for-pcs/"><u>Discover Your IP: Command Prompt Guide for PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/changing-windows-read-only-settings-easily/"><u>Changing Windows Read-Only Settings Easily</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/enthrall-homes-embrace-the-spirit-of-yuletide/"><u>Enthrall Homes, Embrace the Spirit of Yuletide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/tackling-search-service-not-available-on-windows/"><u>Tackling Search Service Not Available on Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/10-ways-to-open-the-windows-recovery-drive-tool/"><u>10 Ways to Open the Windows Recovery Drive Tool</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-best-budget-screen-recorders-in-the-open-source-realm/"><u>[Updated] Best Budget Screen Recorders in the Open Source Realm</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-factory-reset-infinix-gt-10-pro-in-5-easy-ways-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>How to Factory Reset Infinix GT 10 Pro in 5 Easy Ways | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/reactivate-and-enhance-photo-viewing-with-ease-win-11/"><u>Reactivate and Enhance Photo Viewing with Ease (Win 11)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-social-scoops-a-battle-for-short-form-video-supremacy-likes-vs-tiktok/"><u>[New] Social Scoops  A Battle for Short-Form Video Supremacy, Likes Vs.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Speak-Get-Text-Win-A-Comprehensible-Guide-to-Windows-Whisper"><a href="#Speak-Get-Text-Win-A-Comprehensible-Guide-to-Windows-Whisper" class="headerlink" title="Speak, Get Text, Win: A Comprehensible Guide to Windows Whisper"></a>Speak, Get Text, Win: A Comprehensible Guide to Windows Whisper</h2><p> OpenAI’s Whisper is a new AI-powered solution that can turn your voice into text. Best of all, it comes at zero cost.</p><p> However, there’s a catch: it’s more challenging to install and use than your average Windows utility. Especially if you want to use your Nvidia GPU’s Tensor Cores to give it a nice boost.</p><p> Don’t fret, though. That’s why we’re here! Read on to find out how to install and use it, but also, if you own one, to have Whisper take advantage of your Nvidia GPU.</p><h2 id="What-Is-OpenAI’s-Whisper"><a href="#What-Is-OpenAI’s-Whisper" class="headerlink" title="What Is OpenAI’s Whisper?"></a>What Is OpenAI’s Whisper?</h2><p> ChatGPT is all the rage nowadays, and we already saw<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-by-openai/" >how you can use ChatGPT by OpenAI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . And yet, it’s not the only interesting project by OpenAI.</p><p> Powered by deep learning and neural networks, Whisper is a natural language processing system that can “understand” speech and transcribe it into text. But it’s also its own thing, sitting at a spot right among all similar solutions:</p><ul><li>Whisper is an AI solution “trained” on natural language. So, it’s better at understanding “normal” human speech than older solutions.</li><li>Whisper doesn’t come with an interface, nor can it record audio. It can only take existing audio files and output text files.</li><li>Since it’s good at “making sense of language”, Whisper also has the superpower of automatic translation in a single step.</li><li>Whisper is not an online service and can work entirely offline.</li><li>If you have a relatively modern Nvidia GPU (GTX970 or newer), Whisper can run in “hardware accelerated mode” to boost its speed.</li><li>There’s no requirement to register, purchase a license, or buy a subscription.</li></ul><h2 id="Why-Are-AMD-GPUs-Not-Supported"><a href="#Why-Are-AMD-GPUs-Not-Supported" class="headerlink" title="Why Are AMD GPUs Not Supported?"></a>Why Are AMD GPUs Not Supported?</h2><p> For GPUs to be useful for more than graphics, they’d have to act as fully programmable processors. That’s why Nvidia created CUDA, officially deemed “a parallel computing platform and programming model”. To learn more about CUDA and related hardware (“CUDA cores”), read our article on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-are-cuda-cores-pc-gaming/" >what are CUDA cores and how they improve PC gaming <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> CUDA is proprietary Nvidia technology, only compatible with Nvidia GPUs. The closest alternatives for AMD’s hardware are OpenCL and Radeon Compute Platform. To learn more about how each company’s solutions compare, check our article on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/compute-units-vs-cuda-cores-whats-the-difference/" >AMD Compute Units vs. Nvidia CUDA Cores <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Compared to the alternatives, CUDA is considered more mature, performant, and easier to use. Thus, most developers only target CUDA, which, in turn, means that their software only takes advantage of the hardware features on Nvidia GPUs. And that includes Whisper.</p><h2 id="How-to-Download-and-Install-Whisper"><a href="#How-to-Download-and-Install-Whisper" class="headerlink" title="How to Download and Install Whisper"></a>How to Download and Install Whisper</h2><p> Unfortunately, Whisper is not a standalone app you can download, install, and run. It relies on other software, which must also be installed.</p><p> For Windows, to keep this guide simple, we’ll use Chocolatey extensively for installing most of the necessary software parts.

Using this instead of the “plain” version can help Whisper complete its transcriptions much faster with the help of your Nvidia GPU.</p><p>To have Whisper use the CUDA cores of your Nvidia GPU:</p><ol><li>If you already have the “vanilla” version of torch installed, uninstall and purge remnants of it with:<br><code>pip3 uninstall torch</code><br> Once it’s done, follow it up with:<br><code>pip cache purge</code></li><li>Install torch’s CUDA-enabled version with:<br><code>pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117</code><br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pip3-install-torch-torchvision-torchaudio.jpg"                      alt="pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio"                ></li><li>To check if Whisper can use your Nvidia GPU, use:<br><code>whisper --help | findstr -i pytorch</code><br> You should see**(default: cuda)** instead of**(default: cpu)** .</li></ol><h2 id="What-to-Do-if-Torch-Fails-to-Install"><a href="#What-to-Do-if-Torch-Fails-to-Install" class="headerlink" title="What to Do if Torch Fails to Install"></a>What to Do if Torch Fails to Install</h2><p> If you encounter the “no version found” errorwhile installing torch, you may need to install an older version of Python parallel to your current one.</p><p>Use this command to do that:</p><p><code>choco install python --version OLDER_VERSION --side-by-side</code></p><p>Replace “OLDER_VERSION” with a version, like 3.10.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/choco-install-python-alternate-version.jpg"                      alt="choco install python alternate version"                ></p><p> Then, use the path of the secondary version for all “generic” Whisper commands (e.g., “c:\Python310\Scripts\pip.exe” rather than just “pip”).</p><h2 id="How-to-Record-Your-Voice"><a href="#How-to-Record-Your-Voice" class="headerlink" title="How to Record Your Voice"></a>How to Record Your Voice</h2><p> You can use any sound-recording app to turn your voice into a WAV or MP3 file.

Open it in a text editor like<strong>Notepad</strong> to view the translated text.</p><p> We used a translation example because English transcription is even more straightforward: you only have to “lose” the “–language” and “-task” flags. Thus, for plain transcription, the above command would be:</p><p><code>whisper --model base LatestNote.mp3</code></p><p> The “model” flag is required because Whisper uses one out of various options. Let’s expand on them to help you choose the best for your needs.</p><h3 id="Which-Model-to-Choose"><a href="#Which-Model-to-Choose" class="headerlink" title="Which Model to Choose?"></a>Which Model to Choose?</h3><p> Whisper offers various language models. The larger the model, the more improved its accuracy, but also the higher its hardware requirements. They are:</p><ol><li>Tiny.</li><li>Base.</li><li>Small.</li><li>Medium.</li><li>Large.</li></ol><p> Most native English speakers should be fine with the<strong>tiny</strong> or<strong>base</strong> models. Non-native English speakers may see better results with larger models, like<strong>small</strong> and<strong>medium</strong> .</p><p> Note, though, that the medium and large models require over 8GBs of VRAM (that is, “your GPU’s memory”).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/whisper-model-small.jpg"                      alt="whisper model small"                ></p><p> To select one of them, specify the model after the “–model” switch in the command:</p><p><code>whisper --model tiny/small/medium/large [file]</code></p><p>For example:</p><p><code>whisper --model small My_Voice_Note.mp3</code></p><h2 id="How-to-Streamline-Your-Transcription"><a href="#How-to-Streamline-Your-Transcription" class="headerlink" title="How to Streamline Your Transcription"></a>How to Streamline Your Transcription</h2><p> Having to type the whole Whisper command every time you want to transcribe some audio can quickly get boring. Let’s make a globally accessible batch file to streamline the process.</p><ol><li>Run<strong>Windows Explorer</strong> and visit your C: drive.</li><li>Create a folder for your scripts, and copy its path to the Clipboard.</li><li>In the Windows Start menu, search for “path” and select<strong>Edit the system environment variables</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/windows-start-edit-the-system-environment-variables.jpg"                      alt="Windows Start Edit The System Environment Variables"                ></li><li>Find the<strong>Path</strong> variable under<strong>User variables for YOUR_USERNAME</strong> . Double-click on it to edit it. Click on<strong>New</strong> , and paste the path to your scripts folder. Click on<strong>OK</strong> to accept the changes.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/environment-variables-user-account-path.jpg"                      alt="Environment Variables User Account Path"                ></li><li>Return to your scripts folder in Windows Explorer. Create a new batch file there named “wht.bat”. “Inside” it, place this command:<br><code>whisper --model tiny --language en %1</code><br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/creating-wht-batch-file.jpg"                      alt="Creating WHT Batch File"                ></li><li>Create two more batch files, “whs” and “whm”.</li><li>Place this inside the first script:<br><code>whisper --model small --language en %1</code></li><li>Place this inside the second:<br><code>whisper --model medium --language en %1</code></li></ol><p> Congratulations, you now have three scripts for easily using Whisper’s tiny, small, and medium models with your audio files! To transcribe any audio file to text:</p><ol><li>Locate the file with<strong>Windows File Explorer</strong> .</li><li><strong>Right-click</strong> on an empty spot and choose<strong>Open in Terminal</strong> .</li><li>Type this command, replacing “wht” with “whs” or “whm” to use the small or medium language models:<br><code>wht YOUR_AUDIO_FILE.mp3</code></li></ol><h2 id="Typing-at-the-Speed-of-Sound-With-Whisper"><a href="#Typing-at-the-Speed-of-Sound-With-Whisper" class="headerlink" title="Typing at the Speed of Sound With Whisper"></a>Typing at the Speed of Sound With Whisper</h2><p> Even the quickest touch-typists can’t match the speed at which we speak. However, until recently, talking instead of typing wasn’t optimal for creating documents.</p><p> Most voice-to-text solutions produced mediocre results. You could find a few solutions worth trying, but they were complicated to use, or costly. Thankfully, Whisper changed all that.</p><p> After the steps above, you should be ready to transcribe or translate your voice with high accuracy, using only a single command.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/explore-and-manage-windows-11-writable-components/"><u>Explore and Manage Windows 11' Writable Components</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/optimizing-global-communication-hotkeys-for-windows-language-switch/"><u>Optimizing Global Communication: Hotkeys for Windows Language SwitcH</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/safe-harbor-for-windows-free-software-selections/"><u>Safe Harbor for Windows Free Software Selections</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/confronting-the-critical-windows-c0000022-bug/"><u>Confronting the Critical Windows C0000022 Bug</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/fixing-one-sided-windows-headphone-sound-loss/"><u>Fixing One-Sided Windows Headphone Sound Loss</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/tackling-windows-11-no-response-to-click-events/"><u>Tackling Windows 11: No Response to Click Events</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/guarding-against-hidden-threats-in-these-7-windows-processes/"><u>Guarding Against Hidden Threats in These 7 Windows Processes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-proven-mac-screen-recording-programs-beyond-bandicaps-success-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Proven Mac Screen Recording Programs Beyond Bandicap's Success for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-bite-sized-global-cuisines-on-tiktok/"><u>[Updated] Bite-Sized Global Cuisines on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-stand-out-strategy-carving-a-niche-on-tiktoks-map/"><u>[New] Stand Out Strategy  Carving a Niche on TikTok's Map</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-science-of-choosing-music-for-movie-previews/"><u>2024 Approved  The Science of Choosing Music for Movie Previews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-fixing-muted-sound-on-youtube-based-twitter-clips-for-2024/"><u>[New] Fixing Muted Sound on YouTube-Based Twitter Clips for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-discovering-the-secrets-of-asmr-media/"><u>[New] In 2024, Discovering the Secrets of ASMR Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-essential-steps-to-record-films-on-computersmacs-and-phones/"><u>[New] In 2024, Essential Steps to Record Films on Computers/Macs & Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/full-guide-to-unlock-your-oppo-k11x-by-drfone-android/"><u>Full Guide to Unlock Your Oppo K11x</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

If you find that it becomes unresponsive, it can really hinder your productivity. Fortunately, this issue is not impossible to fix.</p><p> Below, we explore several fixes that can help you resolve the right-click menu issue and restore seamless functionality to your Windows operating system.</p><h2 id="1-Restart-Your-Computer"><a href="#1-Restart-Your-Computer" class="headerlink" title="1. Restart Your Computer"></a>1. Restart Your Computer</h2><p> At times, temporary bugs and glitches in the system can cause the right-click menu to get stuck in Windows. The easiest way to get rid of such issues is by restarting your PC. Upon reboot, try using the right-click menu again and check if the issue is resolved.</p><h2 id="2-Update-Windows"><a href="#2-Update-Windows" class="headerlink" title="2. Update Windows"></a>2. Update Windows</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/update-windows-1.jpg"                      alt="Update Windows 11"                ></p><p> Outdated systems are prone to bugs and compatibility issues with certain software or drivers which can conflict with various system components, leading to issues like the one at hand.</p><p> Thus, if you have pending updates available, we recommend taking your time to install them. Microsoft releases regular updates that include fixes for bugs and known issues, which can help you fix the right-click menu issue in no time.</p><p> While you are at it, we also recommend updating your drivers using the Device Manager. Simply access the utility and look for any drivers with warning signs (typically a yellow exclamation mark). Update these drivers and check if it fixes the problem.</p><p> Our guide on <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-windows-software-guide/" >updating Windows, apps, and drivers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> discusses the steps of performing both these methods in detail, so head over to it for further guidance.</p><h2 id="3-Scan-for-Corruption-Errors-and-Malware"><a href="#3-Scan-for-Corruption-Errors-and-Malware" class="headerlink" title="3.

Both these utilities work by scanning the system for underlying issues and fixing the ones identified automatically.</p><p> To scan for malware, you can use reputable antivirus or anti-malware software. You can use one of <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-antivirus-apps/" >the best antivirus apps for Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or if you want to use the built-in tools, you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-remove-malware-using-microsoft-defenders-offline-scan/" >remove malware using a Microsoft Defender offline scan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> If a problem is diagnosed, you can either fix it manually or have the security program do it for you.</p><h2 id="4-Clean-Your-Context-Menu"><a href="#4-Clean-Your-Context-Menu" class="headerlink" title="4. Clean Your Context Menu"></a>4. Clean Your Context Menu</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/clean-context-menu.jpg"                      alt="Clean the context menu via Registry"                ></p><p> Over time, you install various applications on your computer, and some of those add to the context menu. This can lead to a cluttered context menu which can affect its responsiveness and cause delays, leading to issues like the one at hand.</p><p> To fix such issues, you can clean the context menu via the Registry Editor and check if that makes a difference. However, before you proceed, it is essential to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/" >create a Registry backup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, just to be safe.</p><p> Once that is done, here is how you can proceed:</p><ol><li>Press the <strong>Win</strong> + <strong>R</strong> keys together to open Run.</li><li>Type “regedit” in Run and click <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> in the User Account Control prompt.</li><li>Now, navigate to the following locations and delete any unnecessary entries:<br><code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shellHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shellex\ContextMenuHandlersHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AllFileSystemObjects\ShellExHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shellHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers</code></li><li>Once done, close the Registry Editor and restart your computer.</li></ol><p> If the problem was being caused due to conflicts between the context menu entries, this should fix the problem.</p><h2 id="5-Perform-a-Clean-Boot"><a href="#5-Perform-a-Clean-Boot" class="headerlink" title="5. Perform a Clean Boot"></a>5. Perform a Clean Boot</h2><p> Next, we suggest checking for background processes and applications that might be causing the issue with the right-click menu. To do this, you can perform a clean boot, which will start Windows with only the necessary drivers and programs. If the problem does not occur during this diagnostic mode, it indicates that a third-party process was likely responsible for the issue.</p><p> to get started, you’ll need to tell your Windows PC to perform a clean boot. If you’re not sure how to do that, check out our guide on <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-perform-clean-boot-windows-10/" >how to perform a clean boot in Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/" >Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Upon reboot, your computer will automatically boot with minimal programs and drivers. Check if the error appears here. If it doesn’t, it means that one or more of the disabled items were causing the problem. You can uninstall the potential culprits in this case to fix the issue.</p><p> To revert to your normal startup mode:</p><ol><li>Head over to the System Configuration window and click on the Services tab.</li><li>Uncheck the <strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> option and choose Enable all.</li><li>Now, go to the Startup tab and choose <strong>Enable all</strong> there as well.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong> and restart your computer.</li></ol><h2 id="6-Modify-the-Performance-Settings"><a href="#6-Modify-the-Performance-Settings" class="headerlink" title="6.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Deciding-Between-Upgrades-Here-Are-7-Reasons-for-Win10"><a href="#Deciding-Between-Upgrades-Here-Are-7-Reasons-for-Win10" class="headerlink" title="Deciding Between Upgrades? Here Are 7 Reasons for Win10"></a>Deciding Between Upgrades? Here Are 7 Reasons for Win10</h2><p> Windows 11 looks modern and inviting. And you might be tempted to give it a try. But before you jump on the bandwagon, it may be better to stick with Windows 10.</p><p> For starters, Windows 10 is already well-supported. Software and hardware compatibility issues are few and far between. On the other hand, there have been major compatibility issues with Windows 11.</p><p> Let’s see some more reasons why you should hold out on Windows 11.</p><h2 id="1-Unlike-Windows-11-Windows-10-Runs-on-Everything"><a href="#1-Unlike-Windows-11-Windows-10-Runs-on-Everything" class="headerlink" title="1. Unlike Windows 11, Windows 10 Runs on Everything"></a>1. Unlike Windows 11, Windows 10 Runs on Everything</h2><p> One of the biggest reasons not to upgrade to Windows 11 is that you are unable to. Windows 11’s hardware requirements are a significant step-up for some people.</p><p> The biggest and the toughest requirement is that computers will need to have an 8th gen Intel or a Zen 2 AMD CPU with a TPM 2.0 chip. Moreover, the CPU also needs to support secure boot.</p><p> Although these CPU requirements are nothing extraordinary, a surprising number of people are still running considerably older hardware than what Microsoft mandates for Windows 11. If you are one of these people, you have no choice but to buy a new PC to get Windows 11.</p><p> So, if you don’t want or can’t get a new PC, you are forced to stay on Windows 10. But as you will see later on, staying on Windows 10 is not as bad as you think.</p><h2 id="2-Windows-11-Is-Buggy-and-Lacks-Polish"><a href="#2-Windows-11-Is-Buggy-and-Lacks-Polish" class="headerlink" title="2. Windows 11 Is Buggy and Lacks Polish"></a>2. Windows 11 Is Buggy and Lacks Polish</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/virusandbug.jpg"                      alt="computer bug under a magnifying glass"                ></p><p> Windows 11 is less than a year old. Jumping on the latest version of Windows shortly after release is never a pleasant experience. For instance, when Windows 10 launched in 2015, it was buggy. And although the OS did get fixed eventually, people who adopted it initially were essentially glorified beta testers.</p><p> Windows 11 is fresh out of the oven. It is missing features, has a lot of bugs, and new hardware and software compatibility issues are being found and fixed constantly.</p><p> Therefore, if you want a bullet-proof PC experience, it would be better to wait a while before jumping onto Windows 11.</p><h2 id="3-Windows-10-Start-Menu-Is-Better"><a href="#3-Windows-10-Start-Menu-Is-Better" class="headerlink" title="3. Windows 10 Start Menu Is Better"></a>3. Windows 10 Start Menu Is Better</h2><p> Windows 11 Start menu isn’t as helpful as it should be. It doesn’t show your most used or recently installed apps. Instead, it shows apps that Windows 11 would want to use as it recommends Microsoft 365, Photos, Microsoft Store, and so on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Creating-a-new-group-in-the-Start-menu-tile-section.jpg"                      alt="Creating a new group in the Start menu tile section"                ></p><p> When it comes to Start menu accessibility, Windows 10 is simply better as you can quickly launch your most-used apps or get more info about the weather or news through Start menu tiles.</p><h2 id="4-It’s-Harder-to-Change-Windows-11-Settings"><a href="#4-It’s-Harder-to-Change-Windows-11-Settings" class="headerlink" title="4. It’s Harder to Change Windows 11 Settings"></a>4. It’s Harder to Change Windows 11 Settings</h2><p> If you plan on getting a new laptop with the OS pre-installed, it might be shipped with<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-s-mode-guide/" >Windows 11 S Mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . While S Mode is designed to take care of your cybersecurity and keep your hardware performing at its best, it comes with a major drawback.</p><p> While using S Mode you can’t install third-party apps, run command lines, or edit the Windows Registry.</p><p> Even if you leave S mode, there are a few Windows features that are not available by default. For example, you might notice that<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-bring-back-group-policy-editor/" >Group Policy is missing in Windows 11Home edition <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pick-a-default-file-type.jpg"                      alt="Pick a default file type"                ></p><p> Also, even changing simple settings, such as choosing a new default app is more difficult in Windows 11. For example, you can’t set an image editor as your default app for all photos on your computer. You’ll have to set the app as the default one for opening .JPG, .PNG, .TIFF, .NEFF, and for every file type that you want to open with the same app.</p><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><h2 id="5-Windows-11-Is-Just-Like-Windows-10"><a href="#5-Windows-11-Is-Just-Like-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="5. Windows 11 Is Just Like Windows 10"></a>5. Windows 11 Is Just Like Windows 10</h2><p> Windows 11 wasn’t supposed to be a new version of Windows. It was meant to be a substantial update to Windows 10 and termed as<strong>Windows 10 Sun Valley Update</strong> . Microsoft pulled a fast one on all of us by renaming the Sun Valley Update into Windows 11.</p><p> In other words,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-windows-10-in-disguise/" >Windows 11 is Windows 10 in disguise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There is incredible feature parity between the two OSes. Except for a few features, anything that you see on Windows 11, you can find a version of it on Windows 10.</p><p> Until Microsoft delivers on the promised, platform-differentiating features like Android app support, the incentive to move on to Windows 11 is little.</p><h2 id="6-Windows-11’s-Biggest-Gaming-Features-Are-Also-on-Windows-10"><a href="#6-Windows-11’s-Biggest-Gaming-Features-Are-Also-on-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="6. Windows 11’s Biggest Gaming Features Are Also on Windows 10"></a>6. Windows 11’s Biggest Gaming Features Are Also on Windows 10</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gaming-on-a-iPad.jpg"                      alt="gaming on an iPad and streaming it"                ></p><p> Microsoft is calling Windows 11 “the best Windows for gaming” and the company has packed many cool gaming-centric features in the OS to substantiate that claim. Some<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/new-windows-11-gaming-features/" >Windows 11 gaming features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> include<strong>AutoHDR</strong> ,<strong>DirectStorage</strong> , and deeper<strong>Xbox app integration</strong> .</p><p> All the above-mentioned features are either already on Windows 10 or coming to Windows 10, in one form or another. For instance,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/directstorage-windows-10-get-your-pc-ready/" >DirectStorage is coming to Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> even though Microsoft claimed that the feature will be exclusive to Windows 11.</p><p> Similarly, Microsoft had also claimed that AutoHDR is Windows 11-exclusive. We weren’t surprised that the company backtracked on that decision and AutoHDR now ships with Windows 10 Build 21337 in the Windows insider program.</p><p> Next, while Windows 11 comes with the Xbox app out of the box, you can get the same app on Windows 10 as well.</p><p> Finally, when it comes to actual gaming performance, there is<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/graphics-performance-win10-vs-win11#:~:text=Windows%2011%20may%20not%20be,neither%20is%20it%20any%20slower.&text=Interestingly%2C%20the%20RX%206900%20XT,were%20still%20less%20than%202%25." >practically no difference in frame rates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . In some outlier cases, you may get a few more frames per second on Windows 11, but that’s it.</p><p> Long story short, if you were hoping for a measurably better gaming experience on Windows 11, you might be disappointed.</p><h2 id="7-Windows-11-Shows-More-Ads"><a href="#7-Windows-11-Shows-More-Ads" class="headerlink" title="7. Windows 11 Shows More Ads"></a>7. Windows 11 Shows More Ads</h2><p> We already know that there’s no way to escape ads, no matter which device or operating system you’re using. But Windows 11 takes it to a new level, by showing an unnecessary amount of ads. And the fact that Microsoft does its best to “personalize” them doesn’t improve the situation.</p><p> It seems that there’s no way to escape ads while using Windows 11. The operating system displays ads in its Start menu, lock screen, notifications, widgets, and settings.</p><p> Fortunately, you can<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-remove-ads/" >get rid of ads on Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , even if the process isn’t as straightforward as it should be.</p><h2 id="8-Microsoft-Will-Support-Windows-10-Until-2025"><a href="#8-Microsoft-Will-Support-Windows-10-Until-2025" class="headerlink" title="8. Microsoft Will Support Windows 10 Until 2025"></a>8. Microsoft Will Support Windows 10 Until 2025</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/clint-patterson--jCY4oEMA3o-unsplash.jpg"                      alt="Installing a windows update"                ></p><p> Just like it did with Windows 7 after the launch of Windows 10,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-announces-windows-10-support-end/" >Microsoft will keep supporting Windows 10 Until 2025 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This means that if you are running Windows 10, you will continue to get bug fixes, new features, and security patches.</p><p> So, you don’t have to worry about Microsoft abandoning Windows 10 for Windows 11, at least for a few years to come.</p><h2 id="Microsoft-Has-a-Lot-to-Fix-in-Windows-11-but-It’s-a-Good-Start"><a href="#Microsoft-Has-a-Lot-to-Fix-in-Windows-11-but-It’s-a-Good-Start" class="headerlink" title="Microsoft Has a Lot to Fix in Windows 11, but It’s a Good Start"></a>Microsoft Has a Lot to Fix in Windows 11, but It’s a Good Start</h2><p> Microsoft has got a lot right with Windows 11. It has a beautiful design, useful features like Snap Layouts, and is a free upgrade. But, as we’ve just seen, there are still a lot of reasons why someone might want to remain on Windows 10. And most of these reasons are issues that plague Windows 11.</p><p> Let’s hope Microsoft fixes these issues and makes switching to Windows 11 worthwhile.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/windows-pathways-three-keys-to-gaming-files/"><u>Windows Pathways: Three Keys to Gaming Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/understanding-and-remedying-install-fail-in-wins-discord-setup/"><u>Understanding and Remedying Install Fail in Win's Discord Setup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/microsofts-ai-hub-enhancing-shopping-experience/"><u>Microsoft’s AI Hub – Enhancing Shopping Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-a-non-operational-windows-netflix-service/"><u>Troubleshooting a Non-Operational Windows Netflix Service</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/addressing-high-cpu-usage-by-wmi-service/"><u>Addressing High Cpu Usage by WMI Service</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/decoding-and-fixing-error-code-0xc0000001-on-windows/"><u>Decoding and Fixing Error Code 0XC0000001 on Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/speak-up-against-silence-fixes-to-free-your-spacebar/"><u>Speak Up Against Silence: Fixes to Free Your Spacebar</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/deciphering-and-overcoming-windows-1011s-isdonedll-errors/"><u>Deciphering and Overcoming Windows 10/11'S ISDone.dll Errors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-open-a-games-directory-on-windows/"><u>3 Ways to Open a Game's Directory on Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-comprehensive-guide-to-profile-picture-perfection-on-discord/"><u>In 2024, A Comprehensive Guide to Profile Picture Perfection on Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-discover-the-best-stop-motion-software-a-comparative-guide/"><u>Updated In 2024, Discover the Best Stop Motion Software A Comparative Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/prevent-cross-site-tracking-on-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-and-browser-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Prevent Cross-Site Tracking on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and Browser | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-discounted-artisan-logos-best-free-emblem-tools/"><u>[New] In 2024, Discounted Artisan Logos  Best Free Emblem Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-quickening-your-live-feed-on-periscope-platform/"><u>In 2024, Quickening Your Live Feed on Periscope Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-7-phone-number-locators-to-track-nokia-g42-5g-location-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 7 Phone Number Locators To Track Nokia G42 5G Location | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlocking-vimeo-mastery-of-tools-software-and-skillful-techniques/"><u>2024 Approved  Unlocking Vimeo  Mastery of Tools, Software & Skillful Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/updated-discover-the-top-4-audio-editing-programs-specifically-designed-for-mac-for-2024/"><u>Updated Discover the Top 4 Audio Editing Programs Specifically Designed for Mac for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/new-from-youtube-to-mp3-a-step-by-step-guide-to-finding-the-right-converter-for-2024/"><u>New From YouTube to MP3 A Step-by-Step Guide to Finding the Right Converter for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-dive-into-youtubes-best-practices-for-playlist-design/"><u>[Updated] Dive Into Youtube's Best Practices for Playlist Design</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

In fact, trimming and cutting out parts of your videos is an important part of this editing process.</p><p> In cases like that, using the appropriate video-cutting apps becomes paramount for getting your desired cuts. We have scoured the internet for the best apps for this task to help you figure out your video editing needs. So let’s jump right in.</p><h2 id="1-MP4Tools"><a href="#1-MP4Tools" class="headerlink" title="1. MP4Tools"></a>1. MP4Tools</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mp4splitter.jpg"                      alt="mp4splitter"                ></p><p> MP4Tools is a collection of two tools—a splitter and a joiner—that complement each other to help you split or join your videos as required. For your video-cutting requirements, you will use the MP4Splitter app. The app is open-source and can help you break multiple files without re-encoding or losing quality data.</p><p> Moreover, you’ll see a play button when you upload a video on the app for trimming. This way, you can also get a good idea on the parts of the videos you’re cutting right from the Splitter itself.</p><p> Now, when it comes to actual splitting, you can create as many clips as you like and then split them all in a single go. The app is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, and you can download it from the official website with a single click.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.mp4joiner.org/en/" >MP4Tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="2-LosslessCut"><a href="#2-LosslessCut" class="headerlink" title="2.

There’s a lot of overlap in what they can both do, yet they are also very distinct from each other.</p><p> So, what are the major differences between the two, and why are they often associated? Let’s have a look.</p><h2 id="EXE-vs-MSI-Files-What-They-Do"><a href="#EXE-vs-MSI-Files-What-They-Do" class="headerlink" title="EXE vs. MSI Files: What They Do"></a>EXE vs. MSI Files: What They Do</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/screenshot_of_an_exe_file_and_msi_file.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of an exe file and a msi file"                ></p><p> You might conflate an EXE file and an MSI file due to them being capable of very similar things. You’ve most likely installed a program using an EXE file, as well as with an MSI file.</p><p> Understanding how they’re different requires understanding what they do.</p><p> An EXE file is an<strong>exe</strong> cutable file. This is a general term for anything from an installer to a standalone program, or even just code.</p><p> An MSI file is a<strong>M</strong> icro<strong>s</strong> oft<strong>I</strong> nstaller file. This is dedicated exclusively to installing data using the Windows Installer. You cannot run an independent program from an MSI file, but all programs are installed using the Windows Installer.</p><p> Even understanding all of that, there still seems to be some overlap between the two. Let’s dig a little deeper into each one.</p><h2 id="The-Distinctions-of-the-EXE-Format"><a href="#The-Distinctions-of-the-EXE-Format" class="headerlink" title="The Distinctions of the EXE Format"></a>The Distinctions of the EXE Format</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/screenshot_of_iexpress_wizard_create_exe.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of iexpress wizard to create exe"                ></p><p> An EXE file is defined by how highly customizable they are. Because an EXE file can execute any sort of code, it gives ultimate flexibility to developers.</p><p> A developer could insert code, an installer, or even other EXE files within one.</p><p> This leads to the main problem with EXE files. It’s very easy to hide something within an EXE file, such as a virus.</p><p>So, the main distinctions of an EXE file are as follows:</p><ul><li>Can be anything that executes code, such as installers and programs.</li><li>Highly customizable; it’s possible to layer EXE within an EXE.</li><li>Vulnerable to viruses.</li></ul><h2 id="The-Distinctions-of-the-MSI-Format"><a href="#The-Distinctions-of-the-MSI-Format" class="headerlink" title="The Distinctions of the MSI Format"></a>The Distinctions of the MSI Format</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/screenshot_of_msi_right_click_menu.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of the context menu for an msi file"                ></p><p> An MSI file is defined by how limited they are. They will always be an installer package, never a program or unauthorized code.</p><p> They must also meet standardized requirements and no unauthorized code can be inserted.</p><p> This makes them generally safer to run. This is because, essentially, the MSI file type is how the entirety of Windows manages the installation, maintenance, and removal of software.</p><p> This also means that you can actually run into system bugs that prevent the MSI file type from running properly. Thankfully you’re always able to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-installer-package-fix-issues/" >fix issues with the MSI file type, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> but you should still keep it in mind.</p><p>The main distinctions of an MSI file are as follows:</p><ul><li>Can only install, maintain, or remove. No programs or code can be launched.</li><li>Meet safety requirements EXE files do not. Generally safer to run.</li><li>A core component of Windows.</li></ul><h2 id="Is-Either-EXE-or-MSI-Better"><a href="#Is-Either-EXE-or-MSI-Better" class="headerlink" title="Is Either EXE or MSI Better?"></a>Is Either EXE or MSI Better?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/screenshot_of_extracted_msi_and_extracted_exe.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of extracted exe files and extracted msi files"                ></p><p> Not really; MSI and EXE were both built for different tasks and both meet different needs. It’s unlikely you’ll need to directly compare them at all.</p><p> The MSI file type will help you install, maintain, or remove software on your machine. An EXE file can also do this, but it will ultimately use the same system that an MSI file does anyway.</p><p> So, unless a program has provided you with both an EXE and an MSI file for installation, it’s not a choice you’re going to have to make.</p><p>What if you are faced with that choice, though?</p><p> Well, an MSI installer package is more likely to be a straightforward installation, whereas an EXE installer can be loaded up with more options. For example, you might be able to download and install multiple versions of a program using a single EXE file.</p><p> Another aspect is security. If you don’t trust what you’re about to install, seeing it as an MSI file should make you feel safer than if it were an EXE.</p><p> As long as you’re<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-defender-manually-update/" >keeping your Microsoft Defender up to date <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , even that shouldn’t be a huge concern.</p><h2 id="EXE-and-MSI-Working-in-Harmony"><a href="#EXE-and-MSI-Working-in-Harmony" class="headerlink" title="EXE and MSI: Working in Harmony"></a>EXE and MSI: Working in Harmony</h2><p> These two file types, most often associated with installer packages, actually depend on each other quite a lot. An EXE file couldn’t install anything without the Windows Installer, and inversely, you couldn’t run your installed programs without an EXE.</p><p> While they share some similarities, they share lots of differences as well. Thankfully, it doesn’t need to be a choice in most circumstances.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/dealing-with-dual-camera-request-error-code-0xa00f4243/"><u>Dealing with Dual Camera Request Error (Code 0xA00F4243)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/quick-guide-forcing-printer-deletion-in-win-1011/"><u>Quick Guide: Forcing Printer Deletion in Win 10/11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/overcoming-device-detection-issues-with-razer-on-windows-11/"><u>Overcoming Device Detection Issues with Razer on Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/optimizing-your-windows-experience-the-power-of-winstall-for-app-groups/"><u>Optimizing Your Windows Experience: The Power of Winstall for App Groups</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/enhancing-discoverability-of-lost-network-elements-in-winos/"><u>Enhancing Discoverability of Lost Network Elements in WinOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/overcoming-closed-nvidia-cp-window-in-w11-os/"><u>Overcoming Closed Nvidia CP Window in W11 OS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/reorient-your-windows-a-guide-to-90-degree-display-adjustment/"><u>Reorient Your Windows: A Guide to 90-Degree Display Adjustment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/how-to-overcome-exception-handling-error-in-windows-devices/"><u>How to Overcome Exception Handling Error in Windows Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/tips-for-troubleshooting-freezing-spotify-app-on-windows-11/"><u>Tips for Troubleshooting Freezing Spotify App on Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/icy-inspirations-top-olympic-triumphs-for-2024/"><u>Icy Inspirations  Top Olympic Triumphs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamlining-your-editing-workflow-with-final-cut-pro-tips/"><u>2024 Approved  Streamlining Your Editing Workflow with Final Cut Pro Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-a-lost-apple-iphone-14-pro-for-free-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone 14 Pro for Free? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-iphone-6-with-a-mask-on-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock iPhone 6 with a Mask On</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/updated-effortless-video-transfer-importing-and-exporting-in-adobe-premiere-pro-2023-for-2024/"><u>Updated Effortless Video Transfer Importing and Exporting in Adobe Premiere Pro 2023 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-discovering-the-timeline-for-youtube-earnings-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Discovering the Timeline for YouTube Earnings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-expert-tips-for-superior-4k-visual-quality-with-gear/"><u>2024 Approved  Expert Tips for Superior 4K Visual Quality with Gear</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-definitive-list-of-popular-software-for-auditory-disentanglement-from-video-footage/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved The Definitive List of Popular Software for Auditory Disentanglement From Video Footage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-from-gimmicks-to-giants-navigating-popular-short-hashtags-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] From Gimmicks to Giants  Navigating Popular Short Hashtags for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-comprehensible-guide-to-dji-inspire-2/"><u>2024 Approved  The Comprehensible Guide to DJI Inspire 2</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Curbing-Problems-with-Outlook’s-Error-0X80040610-on-Windows"><a href="#Curbing-Problems-with-Outlook’s-Error-0X80040610-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Curbing Problems with Outlook’s Error 0X80040610 on Windows"></a>Curbing Problems with Outlook’s Error 0X80040610 on Windows</h2><p> Microsoft Outlook is a widely used email client, and encountering issues while using it can be incredibly frustrating, especially if your work depends on it. One such error is 0x80040610, which often indicates a problem with the Outlook data file (.pst) or mailbox corruption&#x2F;inconsistency.</p><p> Below, we share the different troubleshooting methods you can try to resolve the issue for good. Proceed with the steps carefully for successful execution.</p><h2 id="1-Try-Some-Preliminary-Fixes"><a href="#1-Try-Some-Preliminary-Fixes" class="headerlink" title="1. Try Some Preliminary Fixes"></a>1. Try Some Preliminary Fixes</h2><p> Before we jump into the specific solutions, we recommend trying some preliminary fixes out.</p><p> You can begin by restarting your computer, which will clear out any temporary glitches or bugs in the system that might be resulting in the error.</p><p> If restarting does not help, head over to the Settings app and check for any available system updates. If any pending updates are available, take your time to install them. This is because often, errors like the one at hand are caused due to incompatibilities between the system and the targeted app.</p><p> Moreover, updates typically contain bug fixes and improvements that can address known issues, including error 0x80040610. You can find detailed instructions on how to do so in our <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-manually/" >guide on installing Windows updates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/update-windows-1.jpg"                      alt="Update Windows 11 to the latest version available"                ></p><p> While you are at it, you can also double-check that your Outlook application is up-to-date.</p><p> Finally, we recommend ensuring that your email account settings in Outlook are correctly configured. If after trying all these basic fixes the error persists, you can proceed with the solutions below. Make sure you are signed in with your administrator account in Windows, as most of these solutions will require administrative privileges.</p><h2 id="2-Repair-Outlook-Data-File"><a href="#2-Repair-Outlook-Data-File" class="headerlink" title="2. Repair Outlook Data File"></a>2. Repair Outlook Data File</h2><p> The Outlook data file, also known as a PST file, contains all your Outlook information, including your emails, contacts, calendar entries, and other similar data. If this file becomes corrupted, it can lead to various issues, including the error 0x80040610.</p><p> An easy way to repair the Outlook data file is by using a built-in tool provided by Microsoft, called “Scanpst.exe” or the Inbox Repair Tool. It works by scanning the data file and repairing any issues identified, automatically.</p><p> We suggest you <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ultimate-windows-10-data-backup-guide/" >create a backup of your data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before you run this utility, just to be safe.</p><p> Once this is done, proceed with these steps:</p><ol><li>Press the <strong>Win</strong> + <strong>S</strong> keys together to open the Windows Search utility.</li><li>Type “Task Manager” and click <strong>Open</strong>.</li><li>In the Processes tab, right-click on <strong>Outlook</strong> and choose <strong>End task</strong>.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/end-outlook-task.jpg"                      alt="End the Outlook task"                ></li><li>Once done, navigate to the following location in File Explorer. X here is the Outlook version you are using. So for instance, if you are using Outlook 2016, click on the Office 16 file.<br>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\OfficeX</li><li>Here, locate the “Scanpst.exe” file and click on it.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scanpst-file.jpg"                      alt="Open the Scanpst file"                ></li><li>In the tool, click the <strong>Browse</strong> button.</li><li>Now, navigate to the Outlook data file (.pst) you want to repair. If you are using Outlook 2019, Outlook 2016, or Outlook for Microsoft 365, head over to the following location in the File Explorer:<br>C:\Users\username\Documents\Outlook Files</li><li>For Outlook 2013, navigate to the following location. Replace “username” with your Windows username.<br>C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook</li><li>Choose the .pst file and click on the <strong>Start</strong> button. The tool will scan the file for potential issues and attempt to fix any issues it detects. You can review the repair log for any warnings related to the problem.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/browse-in-scan-pst.jpg"                      alt="Naigate to the pst file"                ></li></ol><p> Once the process completes, exit the tool and check if the issue is resolved.</p><h2 id="3-Disable-or-Remove-Problematic-Add-ins"><a href="#3-Disable-or-Remove-Problematic-Add-ins" class="headerlink" title="3. Disable or Remove Problematic Add-ins"></a>3. Disable or Remove Problematic Add-ins</h2><p> Add-ins are additional features and programs that can integrate with Office applications to provide you with additional functionality.</p><p> While typically they work silently in the background, there are times when they might get incompatible or start malfunctioning, leading to issues like the one at hand.</p><p> To check if this is the case in your situation, you can temporarily disable or remove the potential culprits.</p><p> Here is how:</p><ol><li>Launch Outlook and click on the <strong>File</strong> tab.</li><li>Choose <strong>Options</strong> from the left pane.</li><li>Now, choose <strong>Add-Ins</strong> from the left menu and expand the Manage dropdown on the right side of the window.</li><li>Select <strong>COM Add-ins</strong> and click on the <strong>Go</strong> button.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/add-ins-outlook.jpg"                      alt="Click on the Go button"                ></li><li>You should now see a list of add-ins that are currently enabled. Uncheck the boxes next to each to disable them and click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes. If you already have a suspect, then you can just disable it, leaving the other enabled.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/disable-add-ins.jpg"                      alt="Disable the add-ins"                ></li><li>Finally, restart Outlook and check if the issue is resolved.</li></ol><p> If this fixes the issue, it implies that the problem was being caused due to one or more of the add-ins. In this case, you can enable them one by one and keep checking for the issue to identify the culprit. Once the problematic add-in is identified, delete it to prevent any further issues.</p><h2 id="4-Increase-PST-File-Size-Limit"><a href="#4-Increase-PST-File-Size-Limit" class="headerlink" title="4. Increase PST File Size Limit"></a>4. Increase PST File Size Limit</h2><p> You might be also facing the problem if the PST file size limit has reached or exceeded the maximum size allowed for the Outlook data file.</p><p> In the event that your PST file has exceeded the limit or is nearing it, below are the steps for increasing it to fix the problem. However, since this method involves using the Registry Editor, we recommend <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/" >creating a Registry backup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, just to be safe.</p><p> Once that is done, proceed with these steps:</p><ol><li>Exit Outlook using the Task Manager as we described above.</li><li>Now, open Run by pressing <strong>Win</strong> + <strong>R</strong> keys.</li><li>Type “regedit” in Run and click <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Confirm your action in the UAC prompt.</li><li>Once you are inside the Registry Editor, navigate to the location below. Replace “<version>“ with the Office version you are currently using.<br>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office<version>\Outlook\PST</li><li>Right-click on the PST folder and choose <strong>New</strong> &gt; <strong>DWORD (32-bit) Value</strong>.</li><li>Name the new DWORD value as “MaxLargeFileSize”.</li><li>Right-click on the newly created value and enter the desired file size limit in megabytes (MB) in the Value data section.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/increase-the-file-of-pst.jpg"                      alt="Increase the size of the pst file"                ></li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes and close the Registry Editor.</li></ol><p> If file size was leading to the issue, making these changes should fix the problem.</p><h2 id="5-Additional-Windows-Based-Fixes-to-Try"><a href="#5-Additional-Windows-Based-Fixes-to-Try" class="headerlink" title="5. Additional Windows-Based Fixes to Try"></a>5. Additional Windows-Based Fixes to Try</h2><p> Apart from the methods we have listed above, here are some additional fixes you can try to resolve the error.</p><ul><li><strong>Run Outlook in Safe Mode</strong>: In some cases, a background application or process might be interfering with the functioning of Outlook, leading to the error. To check if this is the case, you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-boot-safe-mode/" >boot into Safe Mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which launches Windows with only a set of critical drivers and apps. If you are able to run Outlook in Safe Mode, it implies that a background process was indeed the culprit. In this case, you can either manually uninstall the potential culprits or perform a system restore.</li><li><strong>Repair Office</strong>: There might be an issue with the Office installation itself. To fix this, you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/repair-microsoft-office-application/" >use the Office Repair utility <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that is installed with Office by default.</li><li><strong>Scan for corrupt files</strong>: The critical relevant system files may have gotten corrupt or might be infected with a malware, which is preventing Outlook from functioning properly. You can the scan the system for such errors by <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/" >using the System File Checker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This tool will help you identify the problem as well as fix it without much user input.</li></ul><h2 id="Get-Outlook-Back-on-Track"><a href="#Get-Outlook-Back-on-Track" class="headerlink" title="Get Outlook Back on Track"></a>Get Outlook Back on Track</h2><p> All Office errors, including the Outlook error 0x80040610 can be annoying. We hope that the solutions we have listed above helped you fix this error for good. If you have come this far and are still struggling to resolve the issue, we recommend getting in touch with the Official Microsoft support team and reporting the issue to them. Till they provide you with a solution, you can switch to another third-party mail app.</p><p> Below, we share the different troubleshooting methods you can try to resolve the issue for good.

It is the first hypervisor to support the emulation of TPM chips along with all the other system components. VirtualBox also offers a Secure Boot feature in EFI mode for virtual machines. The main reason behind these two features was Microsoft’s list of elaborate system requirements for Windows 11.</p><p> Without emulation of the TPM 2.0 chip, users couldn’t install Windows 11 on a virtual machine. But with VirtualBox 7.0 it is possible to enable Secure Boot and TPM for any Windows virtual machine. This post will elaborate on the methods to enable or disable TPM and Secure Boot for any VirtualBox virtual machine.</p><h2 id="Why-Does-Windows-11-Need-TPM-and-Secure-Boot"><a href="#Why-Does-Windows-11-Need-TPM-and-Secure-Boot" class="headerlink" title="Why Does Windows 11 Need TPM and Secure Boot?"></a>Why Does Windows 11 Need TPM and Secure Boot?</h2><p> Windows 11 needs both a TPM chip and Secure Boot to offer robust protection against threats and not allow any malware to run when the system boots up. Secure Boot only allows signed drivers to load and the TPM chip helps in BitLocker drive data protection. So, both these features are pretty important from a security standpoint. Check out our guide on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-secure-boot-how-does-it-work/" >what Secure Boot is and how it works <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more information.</p><p> While Windows 11 can work without Secure Boot and a TPM 2.0 chip, it won’t be able to offer that extra layer of system protection it would do otherwise. Many features like Core-isolation, Data Encryption won’t work. If you want to enable or disable these features for Windows 10 or 11 virtual machines, you can do so in VirtualBox 7.0.</p><h2 id="How-to-Enable-or-Disable-Secure-Boot-and-TPM-Support-in-VirtualBox-7-0"><a href="#How-to-Enable-or-Disable-Secure-Boot-and-TPM-Support-in-VirtualBox-7-0" class="headerlink" title="How to Enable or Disable Secure Boot and TPM Support in VirtualBox 7.0"></a>How to Enable or Disable Secure Boot and TPM Support in VirtualBox 7.0</h2><p> Repeat the following steps to enable TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot in VirtualBox.</p><ol><li>Press the<strong>Win</strong> key and search VirtualBox.

For many, it may appear as a non-useful utility because you can see a lot of data in File Explorer by changing the icons view. But you can do much more than just view metadata information in the Properties Window.</p><p> Apart from checking out the file type, location, size, and creation data, you can apply access restrictions and even encrypt the folder contents. Moreover, you can enable or disable file sharing, add security measures and customize icons. So, without further ado, let us dive deep into the multiple methods to open file or folder properties in Windows.</p><h2 id="How-to-Open-File-or-Folder-Properties-in-Windows"><a href="#How-to-Open-File-or-Folder-Properties-in-Windows" class="headerlink" title="How to Open File or Folder Properties in Windows"></a>How to Open File or Folder Properties in Windows</h2><p> Here are some easy ways to view the file or folder properties on a Windows PC. These methods will work for Windows 11 and older versions of Windows OS too.</p><h3 id="1-Using-the-Keyboard-Shortcut"><a href="#1-Using-the-Keyboard-Shortcut" class="headerlink" title="1. Using the Keyboard Shortcut"></a>1. Using the Keyboard Shortcut</h3><p> You can view the file properties using the pre-defined shortcut keys on Windows. Here’s how to do it:</p><ol><li>Press<strong>Win + E</strong> to launch File Explorer on your system.</li><li>Click on a file or folder to select it.</li><li>Then press<strong>Alt + Enter</strong> keys at once to open the file properties window.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/view-file-properties.jpg"                      alt="View File Properties"                ></li></ol><h3 id="2-Using-the-Mouse-and-Keyboard-Shortcut"><a href="#2-Using-the-Mouse-and-Keyboard-Shortcut" class="headerlink" title="2. Using the Mouse and Keyboard Shortcut"></a>2. Using the Mouse and Keyboard Shortcut</h3><p> This method eliminates the usage of the enter key to open the file properties windows. Repeat the following steps to open the properties window:</p><ol><li>Open the File Explorer app and navigate to the folder location.</li><li>Now, hold the<strong>Alt</strong> key and<strong>double-click</strong> on the file to display its properties.</li></ol><h3 id="3-Using-the-Context-Menu"><a href="#3-Using-the-Context-Menu" class="headerlink" title="3. Using the Context Menu"></a>3. Using the Context Menu</h3><p> If you don’t want to use the keyboard at all, then you can open the file properties using the context menu.</p><ol><li>Press<strong>Win + R</strong> to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/" >launch the Run command box <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and type<strong>explorer.exe</strong> . Press the enter key to open the File Explorer.</li><li>Navigate to the desired file or folder location.</li><li>Now,<strong>right-click</strong> on the file and select the<strong>Properties</strong> option from the context menu.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/view-file-properties-using-right-context-menu.jpg"                      alt="View File Properties using Right Context Menu"                ></li><li>The file properties window will launch on your system.</li></ol><p> Keep in mind that the right-click context menu will look a bit different from the older versions of Windows.</p><h3 id="4-Using-the-File-Explorer"><a href="#4-Using-the-File-Explorer" class="headerlink" title="4. Using the File Explorer"></a>4. Using the File Explorer</h3><p> You can also view the file properties using the File Explorer app and not press a keyboard key even once. The option to view properties is hidden in the menu bar. Here’s how to open file properties using File Explorer:</p><ol><li>Press<strong>Win + E</strong> to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/" >open the File Explorer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li>Go to the file location and<strong>click</strong> on it to highlight it.</li><li>Now, navigate to the top menu and click on the<strong>three dots (…)</strong> button.</li><li>A drop-down menu will open. Select the<strong>Properties</strong> option from the menu.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/view-file-properties-using-file-explorer.jpg"                      alt="View File Properties using File Explorer"                ></li><li>The Properties window will launch on your system.

Using the CMD Tool</h3><p> The above-mentioned shortcuts launch the Properties window which shows the GUI version of File Properties. But, you can also view the properties of a folder or file using the command prompt on Windows. Repeat the following steps to view file properties using the command prompt utility:</p><ol><li>Press<strong>Win + R</strong> to launch the Run command box. Type<strong>cmd</strong> in the text box and press<strong>Ctrl + Shift + Enter</strong> key at once.</li><li>UAC will pop up. Click on the<strong>Yes</strong> button to open the command prompt with administrator permissions.</li><li>Now, enter the following command and press the enter key: <strong>wmic datafile where “name&#x3D;’File Path’” list full</strong></li><li>Replace the “<strong>File Path</strong> ” with the actual location of your file. We have a text file saved on the desktop. So, the command to display its properties will be: <strong>wmic datafile where “name&#x3D;’C:\\Users\\Test\\Desktop\\rr.txt’” list full</strong><br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/view-file-properties-using-cmd.jpg"                      alt="View File Properties using CMD"                ></li><li>Scroll down to check the file properties such as size, creation date, and more attributes.</li></ol><h3 id="6-Using-PowerShell"><a href="#6-Using-PowerShell" class="headerlink" title="6. Using PowerShell"></a>6. Using PowerShell</h3><p> PowerShell has a different command to display folder or file properties. Like the CMD command, it also displays the file properties inside the shell in text format.</p><ol><li>Press<strong>Win + S</strong> and type PowerShell. Click on the first search result to launch PowerShell on your system.</li><li>Now, type the following command:<strong>Get-Item -Path File Path | fl *</strong></li><li>Replace “<strong>File Path</strong> ” with the actual storage location like you did in the fifth method.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/view-file-properties-using-powershell.jpg"                      alt="View File Properties using PowerShell"                ></li><li>Press the<strong>Enter</strong> key to execute the command.</li></ol><h2 id="Quickly-View-File-or-Folder-Properties-on-Windows"><a href="#Quickly-View-File-or-Folder-Properties-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Quickly View File or Folder Properties on Windows"></a>Quickly View File or Folder Properties on Windows</h2><p> These were the multiple methods to view file or folder properties in Windows.

You can also create restore points manually before making changes to your system, like modifying the Windows Registry, etc. Here’s how to use system restore on Windows to undo recent changes to your system without deleting your personal files.</p><h2 id="Configure-System-Protection-to-Use-System-Restore"><a href="#Configure-System-Protection-to-Use-System-Restore" class="headerlink" title="Configure System Protection to Use System Restore"></a>Configure System Protection to Use System Restore</h2><p> System restore is disabled by default on newer Windows computers. So, you’ll need to configure and enable system restore before you can use restore points.</p><p> You can<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/" >configure and create restore points on Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from system protection. If you have multiple storage drives and want to create restore points for them, you’ll need to enable system protection for the storage drives separately.</p><p> Another important aspect of restore points is storage space allocation. Windows, by default, allocates 20% of storage drive space to save restore points. However, you can increase or decrease the space allocation depending on how many restore points you want to save at a time.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-System-Restore-on-Windows"><a href="#How-to-Use-System-Restore-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="How to Use System Restore on Windows"></a>How to Use System Restore on Windows</h2><p> You can use system restore to undo unwanted changes by reverting your computer to a previous point in time. System restore does not affect your personal files. However, any recently installed program and driver after the restore point was created will be uninstalled.</p><p>To perform a system restore on Windows:</p><ol><li><p>Press the<strong>Win</strong> key and type<strong>system restore</strong> .</p></li><li><p>Click on<strong>Create a restore point</strong> to open the<strong>System Properties</strong> dialog.</p></li><li><p>Open the<strong>System Protection</strong> .</p></li><li><p>Next, click on<strong>System Restore</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/system-restore-system-protection.jpg"                      alt="system restore system protection"                ></p></li><li><p>Alternatively, press<strong>Win + R</strong> to open Run, type<strong>rstrui.exe</strong> , and click<strong>OK</strong> to open System Restore.</p></li><li><p>Click<strong>Next</strong> .</p></li><li><p>Now you need to select a restore point to perform a system restore. Depending on how you have configured System Restore, you may see multiple restore points or just one.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/system-restore-scan-for-affected-programs.jpg"                      alt="system restore scan for affected programs"                ></p></li><li><p>By default, you’ll only see the most recent restore points. Click<strong>Show more restore points</strong> to view all the available restore points.</p></li><li><p>Select a restore point and click on<strong>Scan for affected programs</strong> to view the programs and drivers that will be uninstalled and reinstalled if you proceed with the selected restore point. Click<strong>Close</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/system-restore-finish.jpg"                      alt="system restore finish"                ></p></li><li><p>Make sure the correct restore point is selected and click<strong>Next</strong> .</p></li><li><p>In the confirmation dialog, read the description. Make sure to save any open files and close other open programs.</p></li><li><p>Click<strong>Finish</strong> to initiate the restore process. Your computer will restart to apply the changes. So, wait for the computer to restart. If the restore is successful, you’ll see a success message.</p></li></ol><h2 id="Some-Handy-Tips-for-System-Restore"><a href="#Some-Handy-Tips-for-System-Restore" class="headerlink" title="Some Handy Tips for System Restore"></a>Some Handy Tips for System Restore</h2><p> If System Restore fails, you can retry with the same or a different restore point.

So, the number of restore points depends on the maximum space allocated for system protection.</p><p> Alternatively, you can also manually<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-delete-system-restore-points-in-windows/" >delete restore points on Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to recover some storage space on your computer. If you don’t want to create restore points anymore, you can disable system restore in system protection settings. However, doing so will also wipe out all of your existing restore points.</p><h2 id="Use-Restore-Points-to-Undo-Critical-System-Changes-on-Windows"><a href="#Use-Restore-Points-to-Undo-Critical-System-Changes-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Use Restore Points to Undo Critical System Changes on Windows"></a>Use Restore Points to Undo Critical System Changes on Windows</h2><p> System restore is an excellent Windows system recovery solution to undo unintended changes caused due to Windows updates, driver or program installation, and user modifications.</p><p> After the system restoration is complete, you may find a few partially removed programs with their shortcuts and other files intact. You’ll need to remove them from Control Panel or the Settings app to remove them completely.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/expertly-navigate-and-enhance-text-via-the-snipping-tool/"><u>Expertly Navigate and Enhance Text via the Snipping Tool</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-from-the-service-did-not-respond-windows-error-1053/"><u>How to Recover From The Service Did Not Respond Windows Error 1053</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/how-to-tackle-write-prohibited-files-in-windows-11/"><u>How to Tackle Write-Prohibited Files in Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/navigating-through-0xc00000f-errors-in-windows-os/"><u>Navigating Through 0Xc00000f Errors in Windows OS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/tackling-faulty-microsoft-store-eradicate-0x80072efd/"><u>Tackling Faulty Microsoft Store: Eradicate 0X80072EFD</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/restoring-copy-and-paste-on-chrome-edge-and-firefox-windows/"><u>Restoring Copy & Paste on Chrome, Edge, and Firefox (Windows)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/leveraging-bsod-data-for-system-debugging/"><u>Leveraging BSOD Data for System Debugging</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-pioneering-top-vr-movies-for-enjoyment/"><u>In 2024, Pioneering Top VR Movies for Enjoyment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/full-guide-to-catch-100-iv-pokemon-using-a-map-on-tecno-pova-5-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Full Guide to Catch 100 IV Pokémon Using a Map On Tecno Pova 5 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-captivate-viewers-create-success-a-strategy-for-gamers-channels/"><u>[New] Captivate Viewers, Create Success  A Strategy for Gamers' Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-securely-save-fb-high-definition/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Securely Save FB High Definition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/apples-m1-power-which-macbook-should-you-opt-for-for-2024/"><u>Apple’s M1 Power  Which MacBook Should You Opt For for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guide-to-windows-screen-recording-tools/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Guide to Windows Screen Recording Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-come-up-with-the-best-pokemon-team-on-vivo-y100t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Come up With the Best Pokemon Team On Vivo Y100t? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-crafting-compelling-tiktok-captions-5-must-knows/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Crafting Compelling TikTok Captions (5 Must-Knows)</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

But with VirtualBox 7.0 you can install Windows 11 much faster without performing any registry hacks.</p><p> If you use VirtualBox 6.1 on your system, it is better to upgrade to the newest version. Unlike most apps that auto-update, VirtualBox needs manual efforts to update to the new version. We will elaborate on the methods to update to VirtualBox 7.0 on Windows 11 and install the necessary add-ons.</p><h2 id="What’s-New-in-VirtualBox-7-0"><a href="#What’s-New-in-VirtualBox-7-0" class="headerlink" title="What’s New in VirtualBox 7.0?"></a>What’s New in VirtualBox 7.0?</h2><p> VirtualBox comes with support for Secure Boot in UEFI mode. It can now emulate TPM chips which are a mandatory requirement for Windows 11. Along with that, there are some subtle but useful design changes that make it feel like a latest-gen app. Some menu options appear in new places, but it isn’t something to worry about. Plus, you can enjoy the dark mode on VirtualBox now and protect your eyes!</p><h2 id="How-to-Upgrade-to-VirtualBox-7-0-on-Windows-11"><a href="#How-to-Upgrade-to-VirtualBox-7-0-on-Windows-11" class="headerlink" title="How to Upgrade to VirtualBox 7.0 on Windows 11"></a>How to Upgrade to VirtualBox 7.0 on Windows 11</h2><p> VirtualBox does remind you that an update is available. But unlike most apps, you need to visit the official site and download all the necessary components and the new installer file to upgrade VirtualBox. Then, you need to install the new version on your system which will replace all the files of the current build present on your system.</p><p> But that’s not all! If you connect USB devices to VirtualBox virtual machines, you will have to remove the old extension pack and install the latest one released for the new build. Lastly, you will have to install the new guest additions pack for VirtualBox 7.0. So, let’s begin.</p><h3 id="1-Download-the-VirtualBox-7-0-Installer-File-and-the-Extension-Pack"><a href="#1-Download-the-VirtualBox-7-0-Installer-File-and-the-Extension-Pack" class="headerlink" title="1. Download the VirtualBox 7.0 Installer File and the Extension Pack"></a>1. Download the VirtualBox 7.0 Installer File and the Extension Pack</h3><p> Repeat the following steps to download all the necessary files for VirtualBox 7.0.</p><ol><li>Launch the VirtualBox app on your system. Navigate to<strong>Help &gt; VirtualBox Web Site</strong> .</li><li>The app will redirect you to the official VirtualBox website.</li><li>Navigate to the left-hand side menu and click on the<strong>Downloads</strong> option.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/download-virtualbox-7-0.jpg"                      alt="Download VirtualBox 7.0"                ></li><li>Locate the<strong>VirtualBox 7.0.4 platform packages</strong> section. Click on the<strong>Windows Hosts</strong> option to download the installer file on your system.</li><li>Scroll down and find the<strong>VirtualBox 7.0.4 Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack</strong> section. Click on the<strong>All supported platforms</strong> option to download the extension pack file for version 7.0.4.</li><li>Wait for both downloads to finish and close the browser.</li></ol><p>Now, you have all the necessary files to upgrade to VirtualBox 7.0.</p><h3 id="2-Install-VirtualBox-7-0"><a href="#2-Install-VirtualBox-7-0" class="headerlink" title="2. Install VirtualBox 7.0"></a>2. Install VirtualBox 7.0</h3><p>To install VirtualBox 7.0, repeat the following steps:</p><ol><li>Close the VirtualBox app if it is already running on your system. You can even restart your system for reducing issues while installing the latest version of VirtualBox.</li><li>Press the<strong>Win + E</strong> key to launch the File Explorer app on your system (see<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/" >how to launch File Explorer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more info). Click on the<strong>Downloads</strong> folder and locate the VirtualBox 7.0 installer file.</li><li>Right-click on the installer file and select the<strong>Run as administrator</strong> option from the context menu.</li><li>UAC will pop up. Click on the<strong>Yes</strong> button to continue.</li><li>VirtualBox 7.0 installer will launch. Pick the installation destination and click on the<strong>Yes</strong> button.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/install-virtualbox-7-0.jpg"                      alt="Install VirtualBox 7.0"                ></li><li>VirtualBox will warn you about temporarily shutting the network interfaces. It means you will lose internet connectivity for some time.</li><li>Click on the<strong>Yes</strong> button. The installer will notify you about the missing dependencies. Click on the<strong>Yes</strong> button to install them as well.</li><li>Wait for the installation to complete. Click on the<strong>Finish</strong> button to close the installer window.</li></ol><p> VirtualBox 7.0 will launch on your system. But wait! Don’t close the app yet.</p><h3 id="3-Install-the-New-Extension-Pack"><a href="#3-Install-the-New-Extension-Pack" class="headerlink" title="3. Install the New Extension Pack"></a>3. Install the New Extension Pack</h3><p> Even after you upgrade the VirtualBox app to the newest version, the extension pack doesn’t upgrade along with it. So, it will have the older version of the extension pack which worked with the older VirtualBox version. You need to remove it and install the new extension pack that you download in the second method.</p><p>To install the VirtualBox 7.0 extension pack, do as follows:</p><ol><li><p>Open the VirtualBox app. Navigate to<strong>File &gt; Tools &gt; Extension Pack Manager</strong> .</p></li><li><p>Under the list of active extension packs, you will see the older version with a red sign. It indicates that the extension pack is incompatible with VirtualBox 7.0.</p></li><li><p>Right-click on the old extension pack and select the<strong>Uninstall</strong> option.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/remove-the-old-extension-pack.jpg"                      alt="Remove the Old Extension Pack"                ></p></li><li><p>Click on the<strong>Remove</strong> button to begin the uninstallation.</p></li><li><p>UAC will pop up. Click on the<strong>Yes</strong> button to begin the uninstallation.</p></li><li><p>Now, click on the<strong>Install Extension Pack</strong> button located at the top. Locate the extension pack file you downloaded previously and select it. Click on the<strong>Open</strong> button.</p></li><li><p>VirtualBox extension pack installer will pop up. Click on the<strong>Install</strong> button.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/install-the-new-extension-pack.jpg"                      alt="Install the New Extension Pack"                ></p></li><li><p>Accept the<strong>EULA</strong> by scrolling down. Click on the<strong>I Agree</strong> button.</p></li><li><p>UAC will pop up. Click on the<strong>Yes</strong> button to begin the extension pack installation.</p></li><li><p>Once the extension pack installs, it will appear in the list of installed extension packs.</p></li></ol><p> Now, you can easily connect the USB devices to one or many virtual machines that you created using VirtualBox. Check out our guide on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-virtualbox-add-usb/" >how to add a USB device to VirtualBox on Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more information.</p><h3 id="4-Install-the-Guest-Additions"><a href="#4-Install-the-Guest-Additions" class="headerlink" title="4. Install the Guest Additions"></a>4. Install the Guest Additions</h3><p> VirtualBox Guest Additions offers all the necessary drivers for a virtual machine. Since VirtualBox supports DirectX 11, it is advisable to install Guest Additions as it will offer drivers for all the components.</p><p> Here’s how to install the VirtualBox Guest Additions on a virtual machine:</p><ol><li>Open the VirtualBox app. Click on any Windows virtual machine and then select the<strong>Start</strong> option.</li><li>Wait for the Windows virtual machine to boot up. After that, navigate to the top of the VirtualBox windows and click on<strong>Devices</strong> .</li><li>Then, select the<strong>Insert Guest Additions CD Image</strong> option.</li><li>Open the<strong>File Explorer</strong> app on your Windows virtual machine. You will see the guest additions CD image mounted there.</li><li>Double-click to open the CD image directory. Scroll down and right-click on the<strong>VBoxWindowsAdditions–amd64.exe</strong> file. Select<strong>Run as administrator</strong> from the context menu.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/install-the-guest-additions-1.jpg"                      alt="Install the Guest Additions 1"                ></li><li>UAC will pop up. Click on<strong>Yes</strong> to continue.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/install-the-guest-additions-2.jpg"                      alt="Install the Guest Additions 2"                ></li><li>Follows the on-screen prompts to install the Guest Additions on your system.</li><li>Click on the<strong>Reboot now</strong> option to apply changes to the Windows virtual machine.</li></ol><p> It may take a while to install the guest additions. Once done, you can change the resolution of the virtual machine to match the display resolution.</p><h2 id="Will-the-Old-Virtual-Machines-Work-With-VirtualBox-7-0"><a href="#Will-the-Old-Virtual-Machines-Work-With-VirtualBox-7-0" class="headerlink" title="Will the Old Virtual Machines Work With VirtualBox 7.0?"></a>Will the Old Virtual Machines Work With VirtualBox 7.0?</h2><p> Yes. VirtualBox 7.0 will run the old virtual machines that you created without any issues. But you have to install the extension pack and the guest additions otherwise it could crash or not run at all.
